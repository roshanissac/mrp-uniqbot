# UniQ-Bot: An Advanced LLM-Powered Intelligent Conversational Assistant for Swift and Accurate Frequently Answered Questions (FAQs) Assistance in Universities

This project aims to address the challenge faced by current and prospective students who spend considerable time navigating the TMU website in search of answers to common queries. Despite the existence of a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) section on the university's website, the process of locating relevant information swiftly remains cumbersome. To enhance user experience and streamline information retrieval, the project proposes the implementation of an Intelligent Conversational Assistant, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs).
The project evaluated 4 Open Source LLMs and 4 Embedding Models to understand its performane on FAQs based RAG systems and evaluated it using RAGAS quantitative metrics  and then developed a using OpenAIs ChatGPT-4o . The chosen framework for building the chatbot workflow is the LangChain framework, which facilitates the seamless integration of LLMs. Furthermore, the project incorporates the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to empower the bot in answering domain-specific questions by leveraging extensive training for contextual question answering.
To enhance the efficiency of information storage and retrieval, vector databases will be employed and we have used ChromaDB. These databases will store embeddings that contribute to the contextual understanding and responsiveness of the conversational assistant.
In addition to the techniques, the project uses various quantitative evaluation metrics to analyze the performance of LLMs used in chatbots. Overall, the project seeks to create an intelligent conversational assistant that not only addresses common questions efficiently but also evolves through optimization techniques, offering an enhanced user experience for TMU website visitors.
