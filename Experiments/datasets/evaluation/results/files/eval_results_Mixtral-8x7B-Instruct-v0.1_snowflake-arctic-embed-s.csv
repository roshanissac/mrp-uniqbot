I just want to know the difference between MRP and thesis in the data science and analytics program?,"Sure, I'd be happy to help! In the context of the data science and analytics program at Toronto Metropolitan University, there are two options for a final project: an MRP (Major Research Project) and a thesis. The main difference between the two is the nature of the project. An MRP is an applied project, meaning it focuses on solving a real-world problem or answering a practical question using data science and analytics techniques. On the other hand, a thesis is a research-focused project, meaning it involves conducting original research to contribute new knowledge to the field of data science and analytics. So, in summary, an MRP is more focused on applying existing knowledge, while a thesis is more focused on creating new knowledge.","['What is the difference between an MRP and a thesis  for data science and analytics program?\nThe MRP is a project rather than a thesis.

"What factors should influence decisions on e-mail protocol and retention for student communication, given FOI requests and email uncertainty?","When considering e-mail protocol and retention for student communication at Toronto Metropolitan University, there are several factors to keep in mind due to the potential impact of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and the uncertainty of email retention:

1. Content of Emails: Be mindful of the content of emails, as they may be retained not only by you but by others, and can be requested as part of an FOI request.

2. 'Reply All' Response: Generally, the 'reply all' response should be avoided unless it is necessary, as this can increase the number of people who have access to the email and potentially retain it.

3. Email Retention by Others: You can never be assured of what is retained by others, so even if you have deleted an email, it may still be retained by someone else and potentially released as a result of an FOI request.

4. FOI Request Potential: Emails can be requested as part of an FOI request, so it is important to consider the potential impact of this when deciding on email protocol and retention.

5. Email Uncertainty: Due to the uncertainty of email retention, it is important to be mindful of the potential for emails to be retained and potentially released as a result of an FOI request.","[""Q11: What should be my e-mail protocol and retention in regard to correspondence with students?\nYou should be careful about the content of e-mails as they may be retained not only by you but by others, and they can be requested as part of an FOI request.
