You should contact your referee by email or in-person meeting three to four weeks before the letters of recommendation are due. This will give you time to connect with your referee and give them information about:

The award you are applying for
Why you are applying for it
Your goals and accomplishments
Your resum' or curriculum vitae (CV)
Your community involvement
Any other details
Make sure that your referee knows the deadline to submit the letter of recommendation and how they will be submitting it.

Once you have connected with them, you can submit the letter of recommendation request via the award application in AwardSpring.

You can enter your referee's name and contact information, as well as a message to the recipient. There is a template email already set up in the text box, but we encourage you to personalize your request. When you click Send Request, an email will be sent directly to your referee asking for their support.

The course you are trying to add requires Departmental Permission. For courses requiring Departmental Permission, you will need to contact the department offering the course during the Course Intention Period to have that course manually added to your intentions. You cannot add the course yourself.
Restricted courses: Some courses are restricted (i.e. off limits) for some programs during the course intention period. For example, an RTA course may be restricted to RTA students for the Course Intentions period. The University will make sure all programs that require the course have first enrolment. Only once those students are all in, will any remaining spots become available for general enrolment. This typically happens during the Open Enrolment Period.

The following are considered to be transitory records that can and should be disposed of when no longer needed:
Duplicate stocks of publications, printed literature or blank forms, including those associated with computer-based information systems;
Duplicate records within the same media retained solely for convenient reference or future distribution (examples include branch-wide memos; ""All Staff"" e-mails; notices of holidays, special events or routine administrative matters; and personal desk copies of such items as program studies or committee minutes);
Broadly distributed materials (such as manuals, directives, bulletins and guidelines) used to communicate policies and practices for internal administration (other than original copies kept by the office from which the materials were issued);
Phone messages, personal messages, and records documenting activities such as holiday parties or charitable fund drives unconnected to program functions;
Unsolicited advertising materials;
Publications such as books, journals, magazines, newspapers, newsletters, and published reports which form or will form part of a library's catalogued holdings or are stored within branch libraries or reference shelves;
Publication extracts which have no significant value in documenting how program data was collected or decisions reached, and which have not therefore been integrated within program files;
Temporary working papers such as rough notes or informal drafts that are of no value in documenting data collection or in showing how TMU policies or programs were developed or implemented. (That is, they represent no significant steps in the preparation of a final document, were not reviewed by other persons, do not record program decisions, and do not contain important research or background data.)
Managers should ensure that all transitory items are deleted or destroyed immediately when no longer needed.

Official TMU Records
Official records are distinct from transitory records. Official records serve important business functions, such as supporting program delivery or policy development, or meeting legal, financial and other needs. They may also provide important evidence of institutional decisions and actions. These should only be destroyed in accordance with with TMUs Record Retention Schedule (see Records Management Policy).

Records Containing Personal Information
Anything which has personal information must be retained for a minimum of one year under FIPPA. Personal information includes, but is not limited to: name, home address, home phone number, students email address (home or TMU), identifying numbers (e.g. student number, employee number or social insurance number), education history (grades, degrees received, academic misconduct) health history, or opinions about an individual.  Your professional contact information is generally not perceived as personal information (facultys business phone number, TMU email, business mailing address). See the definition of personal information in the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act available on the General Counsels Information Access and Privacy website.  

According to TMU's Course Management Policy 166, all student work is to be returned to the student before the end of the academic term.  Final exams and unclaimed assignments are the only type of student work that, under FIPPA, will need to be retained for the one-year period because these are not returned to students.  

You should also retain all documents and correspondence that may be part of the academic or academic conduct appeals process. You are required by the Course Management Policy to submit a copy of your grade sheet to the Department/School.","Q10: What types of student and general records do I need to retain and for how long?

International applicants are asked to contact the Urban Development office directly, to discuss eligibility, prior to starting their application.

To be considered for admission, you must meet the minimum program requirements:

Two-year Regular Stream
The minimum grade requirement for admission consideration to a master's program is a 3.0/4.33 (B or equivalent) in the last two years of study within a four year undergraduate (or equivalent) bachelor's degree. (See: Admission Requirements).

A significant majority of our students do not have a previous degree in urban planning.

Applicants with a professionally accredited undergraduate bachelor degree in planning will not be accepted into the two year regular stream program as it is a first professional degree.

All applicants are expected to have passed a university-level course in statistics.

One-year Accelerated Stream
This program is primarily designed for applicants with a professionally-accredited bachelor's degree in Planning, with a minimum GPA of 3.00/4.33 (B) in the last two years of study and significant work experience, who are seeking advanced planning study. Applicants must also have professional experience working directly in the field of planning, with progressive responsibility of no less than five cumulative calendar years of full-time employment. Note that internship and co-op experience is not counted. Applicants who are provisional or full members of a recognized provincial, state, or national planning institute or regulatory body are strongly encouraged to apply.

Applicants with a four-year undergraduate degree (other than a degree in planning from an accredited program) and an exceptional record of practice directly in planning over an established career of five or more cumulative years may be considered for admission on a case-by-case basis. We encourage these applicants to contact our program office to explore their eligibility.

Ventures that are not true social ventures, but rather businesses that have some social aspect.  For example, if your idea is to build a new dating app but donate a portion of proceeds to charity, that does not meet our definition of a social venture because it does not have a social issue at the core of its operations.

Innovators who do not sufficiently support their idea.  We sometimes receive pitches from innovators who propose what looks like an innovative idea but they do not support it with research, an organizational model or a basic understanding of the population it will help, etc.

Ideas that are better suited to a community group or student club.  While social progress often comes from the dialogue and connections that happen in groups of volunteers, such groups are not per se a social venture.","What makes an application to the Social Ventures Zone successful?

Centre of Excellence in Learning and Teaching,Curriculum Quality,Program Learning Outcomes & Program Objectives,How are Program Learning Outcomes used at Toronto Metropolitan University?,https://www.torontomu.ca/curriculumquality/resources/learning-outcoms/#accordion-content-1598552612599-how-are-program-learning-outcomes-used-at-toronto-metropolitan-university--,"Program objectives and program learning outcomes are used at Toronto Metropolitan to guide the design and revision of all academic programs.

New Program Development 
All new program development involves developing program objectives, and identifying the skills, knowledge and capabilities of the intended graduate,  which are then refined into intended program learning outcomes. Both the program objectives and the intended program learning outcomes should be developed before planning courses, or laying out the structure for a program. The courses, structures, and course elements should then be designed to provide students with the experiences required to achieve the programs intended outcomes and to align with the programs objectives. Otherwise, it can be likened to designing a car by providing superb and highly specialized components first, and leaving it to students to make sense of how they may or may not fit together.

Periodic Program Review (PPR)
The PPR process begins with a thorough review of the program objectives and program learning outcomes. Program objectives are developed or updated to ensure that there are clear and relevant goals guiding what is promoted in and delivered by the program. Program learning outcomes are reviewed and updated to ensure that they are demonstrable and represent the relevant, current, and discipline-specific knowledge, skills, and related attributes expected of program graduates. Mapping courses to the program learning outcomes helps identify where and how outcomes are achieved, and supports the review of how the learning is delivered and assessed in the program.

Major Curriculum Modification(s)
Any major curriculum modification involves mapping the changes to both the Ontario Degree-Level Expectations (DLEs) and the program learning outcomes to ensure that sufficient coverage is achieved or maintained. Mapping the modified curriculum helps to ensure that all changes support students achievement of the program learning outcomes, and that there are no resulting gaps or inconsistencies. 

Strong and intentional curricular design at each of these stages ensures learning is thoughtfully integrated and assessed throughout the program so that students can acquire the knowledge, skills, and values/attitudes needed to progress from one year to the next, and to succeed upon graduation.

Backwards design: Once you have determined the knowledge, skills, values and attributes that graduates of your program should have, the next step is to articulate those skills in demonstrable and measurable program learning outcomes. The curriculum is then designed and developed to meet those outcomes.

From publishing and journalism to TV production, fashion, interior design, dance and film, the Universitys diverse media, design and artistic programs will contribute their courses and faculty expertise to the delivery of the Creative Industries curriculum. The utilization of these academic resources in combination with the business courses provided by the Ted Rogers School of Management has resulted in a creative curricular design that, unique among Canadian undergraduate programs, studies the creative disciplines from the perspective of enterprise development and entrepreneurship and blends artistic, media and communication, cultural and business studies to prepare students for employment opportunities in todays creative economy.

The first such program of its kind in Canada or North America, the Creative Industries B.A. program has many novel features, including:

The combination of a B.A. degree with a business specialization.
Creative-content modules: students will complete two 5-course sequences selected from a long list of creative fields: music, publishing, news media, film, performance studies, broadcasting, communication, fashion, curatorial practices, and more
A work placement in a creative company that is integrated into a 4th year capstone project
""Imagining the Creative City""  a unique first-year course that explores how cities embrace and stimulate creativity
""The Creative Process"" - an innovative third-year course exploring how creative ideas happen and how creativity can be fostered in teams and enterprises
Upper level courses focusing on collaboration, teamwork, negotiation and managing creative enterprises"

The Ted Rogers School of Business Management has to set deadlines so that we know what probationary students are doing and whether they are following the requirements approved by Business Council for Probationary students. The probationary students' contracts must be approved as soon as possible so that the students know where they stand and what they are responsible for from the beginning; that's why we try to make that contracts are signed in early June for the Fall semester and as early as possible in the Winter semester.

The Ted Rogers School of Business Management must ensure that the deadlines are enforced so that we know who has complied with the university's requirements. We tried an honour system with the Plans of Study and the contracts before but very few students complied. Many claimed that there were unaware that they had to do so or that they had to meet certain specific requirements. That's why we now make sure that every probationary student is operating under the same rules, and meeting deadlines is part of that. In fact, most probationary students are very responsible about meeting their deadlines. It would be very unfair if those who do not feel they should be subject to the same requirements as others, or who don't bother to find out what they must do on probation, were to be rewarded for their lack of responsibility.","Don't you think it's a bit extreme to make a student lose a whole semester just for a technicality  for Business Management program?

The probationary students' contracts must be approved as soon as possible so that the students know where they stand and what they are responsible for from the beginning; that's why we try to make that contracts are signed in early June for the Fall semester and as early as possible in the Winter semester.

The Ted Rogers School of Business Management must ensure that the deadlines are enforced so that we know who has complied with the university's requirements. We tried an honour system with the Plans of Study and the contracts before but very few students complied. Many claimed that there were unaware that they had to do so or that they had to meet certain specific requirements. That's why we now make sure that every probationary student is operating under the same rules, and meeting deadlines is part of that. In fact, most probationary students are very responsible about meeting their deadlines. It would be very unfair if those who do not feel they should be subject to the same requirements as others, or who don't bother to find out what they must do on probation, were to be rewarded for their lack of responsibility."

Deregistration is not an Academic Standing like Probation or being Required to Withdraw. It is the administrative action taken when students on probation fail to comply with the university's requirement that they should have their courses approved (i.e. a probationary contract). Deregistered students are still in the program on probation; they are simply not allowed to register for a semester. Their transcript will show only that they took no courses that semester; it will not indicate why. Deregistered students are not required to follow any program nor, since they are still in the program, to apply for reinstatement. Space is guaranteed for them in the following semester, as it is for all students who are not on Required to Withdraw, and course selections for the next semester are retained and used to construct their timetables. They are entitled to continue in the following semester, assuming that they have their probationary plan of study approved and their contract signed.

Offer stage one approval and ask the individual and/or team proponent(s) to attend an in-person pitch session with committee members

Proponents who are asked to pitch in person should prepare a basic slide deck (no more than ten slides) explaining their project and why it is a good fit for the Social Ventures Zone.  Each pitch should be no more than ten minutes long and will then be followed by up to 15 minutes of questions from the committee.  For an example of a template presentation, check out Guy Kawasakis pitch guidelines. 

In the event that the venture is not accepted, the committee will provide the proponents with feedback as to why and make suggestions, as appropriate, for further work on the concept, other places they may go for support, etc."

 Budget,2024-27,Funding and Special Projects,Will the university experience any funding reductions this year?,https://www.torontomu.ca/budget/FAQ/#accordion-content-1581354010363-will-the-university-experience-any-funding-reductions-this-year-,"In November 2023, Ontarios Blue-Ribbon Panel on Postsecondary Education Financial Sustainability recommended an increase of 5 per cent in tuition fees for 2024-25 (8 per cent for professional programs), with additional annual increases in future years. The panel also recommended an increase of 10 per cent in the government core operating grant along with annual increases in future years.  

As of late January 2024, the government has not formally announced a decision about the recommendations of the Blue-Ribbon Panel. 

In 2019-20, the Government of Ontario required universities to reduce domestic tuition fees by 10 per cent relative to 2018-19 levels. This brought fees back to approximately 2015-16 levels. Fees have remained frozen at that reduced level. Forgoing a tuition increase for even one year has a cumulative impact that will last for years to come. In every year following the freeze, any increases will be based on a lower tuition amount, meaning there will be a continued gap between inflation and incremental revenue. Fees for international enrolment and cost-recovery programming, activity not supported with government grants, are not subject to this policy.

At the same time, there is uncertainty about how the recent federal decision to limit the number of international student study permits will be implemented, and what it will mean for international enrolment at TMU.

Toronto Metropolitan University will continue ongoing conversations with our sector partners and take part in discussions with the Ministry regarding guidelines and implementation details. In tandem, Toronto Metropolitan University will continue to develop contingency plans and options to address potential revenue loss.","Will the university experience any funding reductions this year?

Here's some advice on what to do if the course you want is full.

Select a Backup Course
Look to see if there is an alternative course that will fulfill the same degree requirement being offered that term. It is always best to get into a backup course and then switch out if a space opens up in the course that you want, rather than run the risk of being left with no course at all. 

Waitlists
Not all courses offer a waitlist option, but a lot do. If there is a waitlist, get yourself on to it, and as people drop the course, you will move up the list.

Make sure you understand how waitlists work, as every year people try to put themselves onto a waitlist for a course that they are already in.

Add-ons are applications created by third-parties (non-Google and non-TMU) and have the ability to interact with your Google Apps for Edu account (your TMU Gmail, calendar and Google drive, and other Google Apps for Edu services).

Individuals cannot turn on the ability to install these services. They must either be enabled for everyone by TMU or for no one. Working with the Privacy and Security officers, CCS has been investigating whether these services should be enabled at TMU.
Each add-on requires the person who used it to agree to permissions such as granting the third party the ability to view and manage your email or send email on your behalf.

The third parties also have separate terms of service from TMU's contract with Google. This means that these applications are not covered by our agreement with Google, which raises privacy, security, legal and records management concerns.  

It also means that the privacy and security requirements we have established for the core Google Apps for Edu services may not be met by these third-party applications.

For example, while testing, we discovered that some of these applications do not support TMU's expectation of 'privacy as a default setting,' one of the seven principles of Privacy by Design.

As a result of all of these risk factors, we have decided not to enable the ability to install add-ons in Google Apps for Edu at TMU.

Please note that by design from Google, TMU users will always see the 'Add-ons' menu while in a Google doc or spreadsheet and while users can browse these add-ons, they will not be able to install and use them since TMU's Google Apps Administrators in CCS have not enabled this service for TMU.","Why Google Docs and Sheets add-ons are not available?

*Note: there is no need to notify the Student Financial Assistance (SFA) office if you drop a course(s). The SFA office automatically makes relevant adjustments to your OSAP application for you throughout each semester. Please note there are possible implications to your OSAP when dropping courses, such as funding overpayments, possible reduction in future funding installments in the same academic year, and/or being placed on OSAP academic probation.

If you drop one or more courses but remain in a full-time course load, you will remain eligible for OSAP but may see a decrease in your funding assessment.

If you drop to a part-time course load or withdraw from all your courses, you will lose OSAP eligibility for the rest of the semester and you will likely see a decrease in your funding assessment.

Note: once six months lapse since you were last in a full-time course load and received OSAP, you will enter repayment. If you drop to a part-time course load but take a full-time course load again within six months and apply for either OSAP or continuation of interest-free status, repayment will not occur.

Dropping courses always poses a risk of having OSAP overpayments, grant to loan conversion, and being placed on OSAP academic probation.

If you drop one or more courses during a term that you received part-time OSAP, you will be required to self-fund for the next semester during which you apply for part-time OSAP and pass all the courses you take that semester.

You then re-apply for part-time OSAP during the fall 2022 term - you will need to self-fund during the fall 2022 term.","What impact does dropping courses have on my OSAP assessment?

At TMU, each course has an assigned billing unit (which allows us to determine your course load calculation for OSAP purposes). Most courses at TMU count as one billing unit. 

However, there are some courses that count as multiple billing units. The number of billing units is determined separately from the grade point average (GPA) weight/academic unit.

For OSAP purposes, each billing unit is equal to a 20% course load. For example, if you are taking one course that is weighted at three billing units, then you would have a 60% course load (three billing units x 20%). 

Therefore, in this scenario, you would be eligible to apply for full-time OSAP.

Laboratory (labs): Some programs may have labs where you work either individually or in a small group to learn and experiment with the course material in a hands-on environment. In many cases labs are mandatory. Please make sure to check the course outline or speak to your instructor for details.
Seminars: These are often used in graduate courses and are small in nature to encourage a great degree of class participation and class presentations.
Studio: Some programs may have studio classes in which you execute a design or production related to your field.","How might my courses be structured for creative industries programs?
