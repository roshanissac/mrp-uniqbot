Add-ons are applications created by third-parties (non-Google and non-TMU) and have the ability to interact with your Google Apps for Edu account (your TMU Gmail, calendar and Google drive, and other Google Apps for Edu services).

Individuals cannot turn on the ability to install these services. They must either be enabled for everyone by TMU or for no one. Working with the Privacy and Security officers, CCS has been investigating whether these services should be enabled at TMU.
Each add-on requires the person who used it to agree to permissions such as granting the third party the ability to view and manage your email or send email on your behalf.

The third parties also have separate terms of service from TMU�s contract with Google. This means that these applications are not covered by our agreement with Google, which raises privacy, security, legal and records management concerns.  

It also means that the privacy and security requirements we have established for the core Google Apps for Edu services may not be met by these third-party applications.

For example, while testing, we discovered that some of these applications do not support TMU�s expectation of �privacy as a default setting,� one of the seven principles of Privacy by Design.

As a result of all of these risk factors, we have decided not to enable the ability to install add-ons in Google Apps for Edu at TMU.

Please note that by design from Google, TMU users will always see the �Add-ons� menu while in a Google doc or spreadsheet and while users can browse these add-ons, they will not be able to install and use them since TMU�s Google Apps Administrators in CCS have not enabled this service for TMU.",,

By clicking Request access, the user is essentially requesting access to the raw form as collaborator. If the original form creator grants the request, she essentially shares the view rights to the raw form (including the spreadsheet behind the form), which should not happen.

Possible Solution:
Ask your students to log out of any personal non-TMU Gmail account. If their TMU mail is forwarded to a personal Gmail Account, they will have to copy the link to the form and paste it to a note/document/text file, then log out of their personal Gmail before that link will work.

For security reasons and to help mitigate phishing attacks, it is important that users are able to view the URL of the CAS login page in the browser address bar. Hence, we do not allow CAS login page to be embedded in other web pages, for example, via an inline frame (iframe). And we have mechanism in place to break out of embedded pages such as iframes.  In such cases, you will get  ""Authentication Required"" CAS page.Sites often embed Google technologies in them, such as Google Calendar, Google Forms and Google Maps etc. Some of these want to retrieve your Google data (your avatar, gmail address etc), so Google tries to authenticate you. Depends on your Google authentication session, if it has timed out, you will be redirected to Google login page. If you’ve used Google Apps for TMU, you will be redirected to CAS login page.
