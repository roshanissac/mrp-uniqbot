It was designed as a place where teams of students, alumni, and innovators from the community could develop viable social enterprises that positively impact social issues.

Alex Gill, our Social Innovator in Residence, provides overall direction and support to venture teams, backed by a team of community coaches and the peer support and encouragement from the other teams.

Social Ventures Zone,Social Ventures Zone,Social Ventures Zone,Who can apply to the Social Ventures Zone?,https://www.torontomu.ca/svz/about/faq/,"From big to small and local to global, we’re looking for creative ideas and ventures that have the promise of sustainability and impact. Toronto Metropolitan University undergraduate and graduate students (or alumni) from any Faculty – or innovators from the broader community – can apply with their idea."
Social Ventures Zone,Social Ventures Zone,Social Ventures Zone,How are projects selected for the Social Ventures Zone?,https://www.torontomu.ca/svz/about/faq/,"Individuals or venture teams can apply with their social enterprise by completing an online application form.  Our Admissions Committee is made up of faculty, staff, fellow entrepreneurs, and community members and meets each semester (three times per year) to evaluate ventures requesting admission.  Each application is blindly scored according to the following criteria:

Potential Impact:   How will the venture impact people or the environment, address a serious concern and/or have a potential to engage community partners?

Degree of Innovation:  To what degree does the venture idea mimic established approaches or does it present a new and innovative approach (and the potential for disruptive change)?

Potential of Sustainability:  Has the individual or team thought through how the venture can be viable (e.g. multiple sources of revenue, support of a partner, etc)?

Personal Capacity:  Does the team lead and/or team members have a demonstrated history of self-starting, a passion for the issue, etc.?

After the Admissions Committee reviews and evaluates the online application, it may choose one of two (2) options:

Decide not to accept the application and recommend other courses of action to improve the idea for resubmission, suggest other places it can find support, etc.; or,

Offer stage one approval and ask the individual and/or team proponent(s) to attend an in-person pitch session with committee members

Proponents who are asked to pitch in person should prepare a basic slide deck (no more than ten slides) explaining their project and why it is a good fit for the Social Ventures Zone.  Each pitch should be no more than ten minutes long and will then be followed by up to 15 minutes of questions from the committee.  For an example of a template presentation, check out Guy Kawasaki’s pitch guidelines. 

In the event that the venture is not accepted, the committee will provide the proponents with feedback as to why and make suggestions, as appropriate, for further work on the concept, other places they may go for support, etc."
Social Ventures Zone,Social Ventures Zone,Social Ventures Zone,What makes an application to the Social Ventures Zone successful?,https://www.torontomu.ca/svz/about/faq/,"The Social Ventures Zone receives dozens of applications for each round of admissions and our Admissions Committee selects the ones that best fit the criteria for admission. But in addition to the criteria outlined above, we often receive applications that are rejected because they fall into the following categories:

Ventures that are not true social ventures, but rather businesses that have some social aspect.  For example, if your idea is to build a new dating app but donate a portion of proceeds to charity, that does not meet our definition of a social venture because it does not have a social issue at the core of its operations.

Innovators who do not sufficiently support their idea.  We sometimes receive pitches from innovators who propose what looks like an innovative idea but they do not support it with research, an organizational model or a basic understanding of the population it will help, etc.

Ideas that are better suited to a community group or student club.  While social progress often comes from the dialogue and connections that happen in groups of volunteers, such groups are not per se a social venture."

Social Ventures Zone,Social Ventures Zone,Social Ventures Zone,How much time do I need to commit to participate in the Social Ventures Zone?,https://www.torontomu.ca/svz/about/faq/,"Venture team members are expected to contribute a minimum of 10-12 hours per month to their social enterprise.  This includes your participation in workshops and modules, time dedicated to your venture, and ongoing peer-to-peer collaboration.

On that note, we believe in helping, not holding back. While focus is a good thing, we know that innovators sometimes need encouragement.  They need to know others believe in them and can pitch in to help, when needed.  That is why we want the Social Ventures Zone to be a space where we actively look for opportunities to help our fellow innovators when we see them facing a challenge.  Because what we give, we get back."
