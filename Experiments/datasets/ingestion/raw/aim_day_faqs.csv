Once registered, primary contacts will be contacted to start the process of developing or fine-tuning the organization’s research question. Questions will be tailored to target optimal discussion.
Organizations register up to two people to participate in AIMday, which can (but does not have to) include the primary contact. Additional registrants may be added as observers at the discretion of the organization.
At any time, if it is necessary to change any registration information, organizations should contact Lisa Leung, Manager, Collaborations, Programs & Initiatives at Toronto Metropolitan University."
