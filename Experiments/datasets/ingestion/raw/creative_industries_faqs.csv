Select a Backup Course
Look to see if there is an alternative course that will fulfill the same degree requirement being offered that term. It is always best to get into a backup course and then switch out if a space opens up in the course that you want, rather than run the risk of being left with no course at all. 

Waitlists
Not all courses offer a waitlist option, but a lot do. If there is a waitlist, get yourself on to it, and as people drop the course, you will move up the list.

Make sure you understand how waitlists work, as every year people try to put themselves onto a waitlist for a course that they are already in.
