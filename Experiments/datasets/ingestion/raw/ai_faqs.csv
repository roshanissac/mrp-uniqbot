Academic Integrity Office,Artififical Intelligence,Use of AI in Academics,Should students use AI?,https://www.torontomu.ca/academicintegrity/ai/#accordion-content-1677615447935-should-students-use-ai-,"Unless explicitly stated by the instructor, students should assume that using AI to complete assessments is prohibited. If students use AI to complete assessments, instructors may consider it 1) misrepresentation of personal identity or performance and/or 2) plagiarism and/or 3) cheating.

IF your instructor gives you permission to use AI, the expectation is that you cite the output just as you would cite any other source. 

APA, MLA, Chicago Style

While AI is something that should be avoided when creating anything that will be evaluated by your professor, AI can be a great learning companion, assuming you understand that AI output needs to be critically evaluated. Cornell University devised these key questions that you can use to interrogate the integrity of the AI output:

Is the AI-generated content accurate? How can you test or assess the accuracy?
Can other credible sources (outside of generative AI) validate the data or item produced? 
How does the information generated impact or influence your thinking on this topic?
Who is represented in this data? Is the data inclusive in terms of the material�s scope and the perspectives that it presents? 
As well, we have some student tips that you may find useful."
Academic Integrity Office,Artififical Intelligence,Use of AI in Academics,Does Policy 60: Academic Integrity prohibit student use of AI for assessments?,https://www.torontomu.ca/academicintegrity/ai/#accordion-content-1677615447888-does-policy-60--academic-integrity-prohibit-student-use-of-ai-for-assessments-,"Currently, Policy 60 does not explicitly address AI usage. However, if a student were to submit text, images, designs or any other academic work generated by AI without proper attribution, instructors could consider that plagiarism. Further, instructors could consider AI use to be cheating as described in Policy 60, Appendix A, Section 3.1:

�having ready access to and/or using aids or devices (including wireless communication devices) not expressly allowed by the instructor during an examination, test, quiz, or other evaluation.�

* Please note that Policy 60 is currently under review and we anticipate that specific language on artificial intelligence will be added."

Learn about the technology, external link and read OpenAI�s Educator Considerations for ChatGPT
Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of AI Large Language Models (LLMs) with your students
Set very clear academic integrity parameters (Are translators allowed? Grammar correctors? Can students use it to brainstorm?)
Establish citation expectations (See below for an APA example you can use until an official practice is established.)

The AIO provides presentations and workshops on AI Literacy, Leveraging AI in the Classroom, and Mitigating the impact of AI on Student Assessment. If you'd like to request a presentation, please complete this form.

Additionally, a community of practice has been formed to share resources and discuss best practices. If you'd like to join the community of practice, you can do so here.

The AIO also encourages faculty to explore these tools, test them, learn about how they work and what their limitations are, so that they're better equipped to address these matters in the classroom.

Sample syllabus statement suggestions:
�If you submit work that doesn�t reasonably reflect your knowledge of the material and/or the skills being assessed, that work will be considered to be in breach of Policy 60: Academic Integrity.�
�The unauthorized use of Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Quillbot, Grammarly, Google Translate) is prohibited and will be considered to be in breach of Policy 60: Academic Integrity.�
�Generative AI may only be used for idea generation or as a study aid, but not for the creation of submitted work.�
�Falsified citations or misrepresentation of source material will be considered a breach of Policy 60. You are responsible for the accuracy of the work you submit.�"
