They serve as essential reference points for academic departments to discuss the elements that contribute to an integrated program of study. The Ontario Quality Framework requires programs to be intentional about the choice and development of their program outcomes and to clearly communicate their roadmap for student learning.

For instructors, program learning outcomes provide a broad picture of the program and offer insights into how each course and other program experiences contribute to the development of the knowledge, skills, and values/attitudes expected of their graduates. 

For students, program learning outcomes communicate the skills successful graduates will develop, and the types of knowledge they learn in preparation for employment, further education, and to participate as critically informed citizens. 

For employers, program learning outcomes outline what they can confidently expect from potential employees.",

Program goals or objectives are part of the planning process. They describe what a program plans or seeks to achieve. The focus is on what is promoted in and delivered by the program (e.g. broad areas of focus or approach(es), learning activities used, and experiences or opportunities offered). Program objectives also help define what makes the program unique and meaningful, and ultimately provide direction and justification for program and course-level curricular decisions.

In contrast, program learning outcomes focus on the skills developed by graduates, outlining the knowledge, skills, and values/attitudes that a graduate will be able to demonstrate. Rather than focus on the material that will be covered or the experiences they’ll have, program learning outcomes focus on how students understand and employ that material and the specific knowledge, skills and attitudes they will be able to demonstrate as a resul",
Centre of Excellence in Learning and Teaching,Curriculum Quality,Program Learning Outcomes & Program Objectives,How are Program Learning Outcomes used at Toronto Metropolitan University?,https://www.torontomu.ca/curriculumquality/resources/learning-outcoms/#accordion-content-1598552612599-how-are-program-learning-outcomes-used-at-toronto-metropolitan-university--,"Program objectives and program learning outcomes are used at Toronto Metropolitan to guide the design and revision of all academic programs.

New Program Development 
All new program development involves developing program objectives, and identifying the skills, knowledge and capabilities of the intended graduate,  which are then refined into intended program learning outcomes. Both the program objectives and the intended program learning outcomes should be developed before planning courses, or laying out the structure for a program. The courses, structures, and course elements should then be designed to provide students with the experiences required to achieve the program’s intended outcomes and to align with the program’s objectives. Otherwise, it can be likened to designing a car by providing superb and highly specialized components first, and leaving it to students to make sense of how they may or may not fit together.

Periodic Program Review (PPR)
The PPR process begins with a thorough review of the program objectives and program learning outcomes. Program objectives are developed or updated to ensure that there are clear and relevant goals guiding what is promoted in and delivered by the program. Program learning outcomes are reviewed and updated to ensure that they are demonstrable and represent the relevant, current, and discipline-specific knowledge, skills, and related attributes expected of program graduates. Mapping courses to the program learning outcomes helps identify where and how outcomes are achieved, and supports the review of how the learning is delivered and assessed in the program.

Major Curriculum Modification(s)
Any major curriculum modification involves mapping the changes to both the Ontario Degree-Level Expectations (DLEs) and the program learning outcomes to ensure that sufficient coverage is achieved or maintained. Mapping the modified curriculum helps to ensure that all changes support students’ achievement of the program learning outcomes, and that there are no resulting gaps or inconsistencies. 

Strong and intentional curricular design at each of these stages ensures learning is thoughtfully integrated and assessed throughout the program so that students can acquire the knowledge, skills, and values/attitudes needed to progress from one year to the next, and to succeed upon graduation.

Backwards design: Once you have determined the knowledge, skills, values and attributes that graduates of your program should have, the next step is to articulate those skills in demonstrable and measurable program learning outcomes. The curriculum is then designed and developed to meet those outcomes.

Your Curriculum Specialist will provide support and guidance when developing objectives and learning outcomes for new programs. Please contact us for additional information or support.

Periodic Program Review 
Revising program goals and program learning outcomes for program review should include the core PPR team consisting of faculty members and an administrative assistant.

We use the Curriculum Insights (CI) application for program mapping. In addition to generating a comprehensive curriculum map, CI also generates reports that map teaching and assessment methods, for incorporation into the PPR self-study.

Analysing the curriculum map with program instructors helps clarify and unify program expectations, facilitates collaborative planning, and helps the program plan future changes and enhancements to maintain the integrity and coherence of the program. Analysing the program map in light of other PPR data points (e.g. student, alumni, and employer feedback; industry trends, advancements in the field; program advisory council feedback, etc.) also helps to identify and prioritize opportunities for program enhancement.

The program-wide lens supports curricular analysis and helps to identify:

program strengths 
areas for enhancement
program-specific evidence and metrics
This information informs and supports future curriculum modifications, thereby improving the quality of the learning experience for students. The PRR self study is, therefore, both an analysis of a program’s current state and development since the last review, as well as a planning tool in a forward-facing document meant to guide future development.

More broadly, the objective of PPR is to examine the quality of degree programs to ensure that they achieve and maintain the highest possible standards of academic excellence and continue to satisfy societal need.  Although the PPR process and requirements are guided by Ryerson’s IQAP, the creation of the PPR self-study is program-led and involves the contributions of faculty, staff, students, and program stakeholders.
