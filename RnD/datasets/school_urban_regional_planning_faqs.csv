We enroll approximately 30 students every year, selected from a highly competitive applicant pool.

International applicants are asked to contact the Urban Development office directly, to discuss eligibility, prior to starting their application.

To be considered for admission, you must meet the minimum program requirements:

Two-year Regular Stream
The minimum grade requirement for admission consideration to a master's program is a 3.0/4.33 (B or equivalent) in the last two years of study within a four year undergraduate (or equivalent) bachelor's degree. (See: Admission Requirements).

A significant majority of our students do not have a previous degree in urban planning.

Applicants with a professionally accredited undergraduate bachelor degree in planning will not be accepted into the two year regular stream program as it is a first professional degree.

All applicants are expected to have passed a university-level course in statistics.

One-year Accelerated Stream
This program is primarily designed for applicants with a professionally-accredited bachelor's degree in Planning, with a minimum GPA of 3.00/4.33 (B) in the last two years of study and significant work experience, who are seeking advanced planning study. Applicants must also have professional experience working directly in the field of planning, with progressive responsibility of no less than five cumulative calendar years of full-time employment. Note that internship and co-op experience is not counted. Applicants who are provisional or full members of a recognized provincial, state, or national planning institute or regulatory body are strongly encouraged to apply.

Applicants with a four-year undergraduate degree (other than a degree in planning from an accredited program) and an exceptional record of practice directly in planning over an established career of five or more cumulative years may be considered for admission on a case-by-case basis. We encourage these applicants to contact our program office to explore their eligibility.

Internationally Trained Planning Professionals

Internationally trained planning professionals who are Canadian citizens or permanent residents with demonstrated planning knowledge and experience are highly encouraged to apply. Our accredited planning program provides the needed skills and hands-on training to transition and advance applicants� planning careers in the Canadian context. The program of study can be adapted, as needed, for internationally trained planners to gain experience with Canadian urban planning ethics and governance. Applicants are required to demonstrate English language proficiency at the minimum level required by the Yeates School of Graduate Studies if previous education was not instructed in English. You can learn more  from the Graduate Studies Admission Requirements page.  All applicants to our 1-year program must have passed a university-level course in statistics prior to starting the program. Strong applicants who have not yet completed this statistics learning should contact the program to discuss options for completion before applying."
