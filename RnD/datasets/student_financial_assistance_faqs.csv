To protect your safety, we do not accept documents by mail, fax, or in person.

Before submitting, be sure to complete all fillable fields on your document(s). Not sure how to complete PDF forms online? Learn how to complete fillable forms from your computer using Adobe Acrobat DC.

You can create a PDF version of your supporting documents directly from your phone. Below are some free phone applications that you can use to scan documents as PDF. Please note that the University does not endorse, nor is liable, for any privacy breaches associated with the usage of these applications. Students should use these applications at their own risk:

CamScanner (for iOS or Android Users)
Scanbot SDK (for iOS or Android users)
SwiftScan (for iOS or Android users)
Evernote Scannable (for iOS users)
Adobe Scan (for iOS users)
Notes (for iOS users)
Microsoft Lens (for iOS or Android Users)
Once you create a PDF on your phone, you can email the documents to yourself to upload onto your OSAP portal—it is easier to upload the actual documents directly from a computer.

How to scan documents from a computer
You can also scan your documents as a PDF onto your computer, then upload them to your OSAP portal. Please ensure that your documents are formatted as follows:

Scanned as black and white, even if the document is in colour.
Scan each required document separately. Do not merge files.
2 megabytes (MB) or less in file size. PDF files that are larger than 2 MB (or 2,000 kilobytes/KB) must be compressed. Otherwise, the file will be too large to upload on the OSAP portal. The exception to this is Declaration and Signature Pages, which can be up to 5MB.
When scanning, if you have a DPI (Dots Per Inch) option, set it to 150 or 200. Otherwise, use the smallest option to create the file.
Select a text-style scanning option rather than a photo or picture option.
Make sure your scanned document is clear and easy to read before saving it as a PDF (.pdf) file format.
More information about scanning and uploading your supporting documents can be found on the Required Document page of your OSAP application.

Documents are reviewed within 3 to 6 weeks from your date of submission. Once reviewed, you will receive an update via your OSAP message centre."
Student Financial Assistance,Scholarships and Awards,OSAP,What impact does dropping courses have on my OSAP assessment?,https://www.torontomu.ca/student-financial-assistance/osap/faqs/#accordion-content-1599590211781-what-impact-does-dropping-courses-have-on-my-osap-assessment-,"Full-time OSAP applicants
*Note: there is no need to notify the Student Financial Assistance (SFA) office if you drop a course(s). The SFA office automatically makes relevant adjustments to your OSAP application for you throughout each semester. Please note there are possible implications to your OSAP when dropping courses, such as funding overpayments, possible reduction in future funding installments in the same academic year, and/or being placed on OSAP academic probation.

If you drop one or more courses but remain in a full-time course load, you will remain eligible for OSAP but may see a decrease in your funding assessment.

If you drop to a part-time course load or withdraw from all your courses, you will lose OSAP eligibility for the rest of the semester and you will likely see a decrease in your funding assessment.

Note: once six months lapse since you were last in a full-time course load and received OSAP, you will enter repayment. If you drop to a part-time course load but take a full-time course load again within six months and apply for either OSAP or continuation of interest-free status, repayment will not occur.

Dropping courses always poses a risk of having OSAP overpayments, grant to loan conversion, and being placed on OSAP academic probation.

Part-time OSAP applicants
*Note: there is no need to notify the Student Financial Assistance (SFA) office if you drop a course(s). The SFA office automatically makes relevant adjustments to your OSAP application for you throughout each semester. 

If you drop one or more courses during a term that you received part-time OSAP, you will be required to self-fund for the next semester during which you apply for part-time OSAP and pass all the courses you take that semester.

Example: During the fall 2021 term, you receive part-time OSAP and then drop one course. You apply and receive full-time OSAP during the winter 2022 term. You then re-apply for part-time OSAP during the fall 2022 term - you will need to self-fund during the fall 2022 term."

In-person: You can do an OAN or password reset at any public College or University in Ontario. You do not have to complete it at the institution you attended. If you opt to come in person at TMU, we offer OAN or password reset on a walk-in basis through the ServiceHub.

Student Financial Assistance,Scholarships and Awards,OSAP,Is my course load calculated by billing units or by enrolled courses?,https://www.torontomu.ca/student-financial-assistance/osap/faqs/#accordion-content-1626357762565-is-my-course-load-calculated-by-billing-units-or-by-enrolled-courses-,"For OSAP purposes, your course load is determined based on the number of billings units associated with your enrolment.

At TMU, each course has an assigned billing unit (which allows us to determine your course load calculation for OSAP purposes). Most courses at TMU count as one billing unit. 

However, there are some courses that count as multiple billing units. The number of billing units is determined separately from the grade point average (GPA) weight/academic unit.

For OSAP purposes, each billing unit is equal to a 20% course load. For example, if you are taking one course that is weighted at three billing units, then you would have a 60% course load (three billing units x 20%). 

Therefore, in this scenario, you would be eligible to apply for full-time OSAP. To see how many billing units a course is worth, please refer to your academic program section of the Undergraduate Calendar. The screenshot below shows an example of a course that counts as multiple billing units."
Student Financial Assistance,Scholarships and Awards,OSAP,I added or dropped a course after my OSAP was confirmed. Do I need to report this to the university?,https://www.torontomu.ca/student-financial-assistance/osap/faqs/#accordion-content-1645112995156-i-added-or-dropped-a-course-after-my-osap-was-confirmed--do-i-need-to-report-this-to-the-university-,"We encourage students to finalize their course load promptly before the start of term to avoid delays in their OSAP funding disbursements.

You do not need to notify the university if your course load changed as a result of you adding or dropping courses unless a staff member has advised you to do so. 

The SFA office audits students’ course loads regularly throughout each semester to identify course load changes and adjusts OSAP applications accordingly.  If your adjusted course load results in any additional funding, it will automatically be released to the student. For information on the impacts of dropping a course, visit “What impact does dropping courses have on my OSAP assessment?”"
