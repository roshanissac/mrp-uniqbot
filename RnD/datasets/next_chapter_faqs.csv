Alumni,Alumni,Next Chapter,How did the university go about the renaming process?,https://www.torontomu.ca/next-chapter/frequently-asked-questions/#accordion-content-1650914757450-how-did-the-university-go-about-the-renaming-process-,"Following the Board of Governors' August 2021 decision to accept the Standing Strong Task Force recommendations, President Lachemi announced our commitment to determining a new name by the end of the 2021/22 academic year. To reach this goal, the University Renaming Advisory Committee (URAC) was established. 

In April 2022, the URAC concluded their community and expert informed process and submitted a shortlist of possible names for President Lachemi’s consideration. After careful deliberation, one of the names was recommended to the Board of Governors for approval.
