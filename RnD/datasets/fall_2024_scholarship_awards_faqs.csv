Entrance scholarship renewals assess your CGPA from the end of the most recent winter semester. Your CGPA is the average of all your course grades to date, not individual year, or semester GPAs.

You can see your CGPA at the end of each semester by going to your student centre in MyServiceHub and selecting ""Grades."" Then select the appropriate winter term, and at the top, you will be able to see your cumulative total at the end of that semester."

Students who withdraw, discontinue their program, reduce their course load, experience a decline in grades below the minimum CGPA requirement, or no longer meet other scholarship/award requirements may forfeit all or part of their award.

The decision is made by the Student Awards and Scholarships Office and is based on the terms of the scholarship. A cancelled scholarship may result in a charge against the student’s university fee account."

Scholarship renewals occur in the fall semester of each academic year and the total value for the year is disbursed evenly between the fall and winter semesters. 

Applicable only to TMU's Guaranteed Entrance and Renewable Scholarships, entrance scholarship renewals may be applied to student accounts in three consecutive fall and winter terms, regardless of when their co-op placements fall. Your most recent winter CGPA will be used in the calculation of the renewal amount.

Participating in a co-op program that extends your studies to five years does not extend your scholarship eligibility by an extra year.
