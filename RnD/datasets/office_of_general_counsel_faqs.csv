Office of the General Counsel and Board Secretariat,Record Management,Record Management,Q_: Why don't I just keep everything forever?,https://www.torontomu.ca/gcbs/what-we-do/records/records-resources/rm-faqs/#accordion-content-1508250235722-q---why-don-t-i-just-keep-everything-forever-,"There are several risks associated wtih keeping information forever, such as personal information should only be retained as long as is necessary for stated purposes and use, and could be subject to access requests at any time.  In addition, keeping unecessary information longer than needed takes up space, both virtual/electronic and physical, which costs time and money to manage.  For example, keeping legacy information in systems may impact the time it takes to backup and restore information, which is costly even though storage is much more inexpensive.

In addition, if we have it and there is an access request we have to produce it even if it is past due for destruction.  The same principle applies to legal holds.  Destroying records to avoid an access request is a punishable offence under FIPPA."

These are not the same thing. 

Archiving means to transfer records to the University Archives after their retention has expired. Refer to A&SC Collections Policy information for Potential Donors for additional information or contact archives@torontomu.ca.  

Not all permanent records are archival; permanent records remain the responsibility of the originating department as there are certain classes of records that must be retained permanently but would not be sent to the Archives. 

When records no longer need to be regularly accessed but must be retained for longer, they can be transferred to off-campus storage and destroyed at the end of their retention period.  The Responsible Office retains control over access and authorizes the final destruction of these records. "
