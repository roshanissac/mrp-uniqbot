We are building this medical school with the communities it will serve. Brampton residents, community agencies and health partners have all provided unwavering support in project approvals, planning, and development so we will be ready to welcome our first cohort of medical students and residents in 2025. 

Brampton’s population has increased rapidly and the region’s growth has been shaped by immigration. It is also a region of the province that has been chronically underfunded and has been hit by a higher rate of occurrence of COVID-19.

In addition, Brampton and Toronto Metropolitan University have existing partnerships through several initiatives, including the Cybersecure Catalyst, and Brampton Ventures Zone."

Our university has been on its own path of Truth and Reconciliation with the work of the Standing Strong Task Force. As a starting point, we draw inspiration from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s final report and in particular Calls to Action 18 through 24, which specifically address the need for action for Indigenous health. Of these, Calls to Action 22 through 24 are the most relevant to medical school contexts. In particular, they address the need for Indigenous understandings of health and well-being, a holistic admissions process and the creation of pathway programs for Indigenous learners.

In addition, the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada’s Indigenous Working Group has provided a crucial roadmap for the implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Calls to Action in their Joint Commitment to Action on Indigenous Health. Their report highlights the importance of accountability and of thoughtful, reciprocal relationships with Indigenous communities to advance Reconciliation and Indigenous health.

Both documents serve as an important reminder of the need to form respectful, reciprocal, long-term relationships with Indigenous-led organizations early in the planning process to set the foundation for a meaningful commitment to Action. The university is committed to developing meaningful relationships with Indigenous communities through a co-creation approach to define the terms of the relationship and ensuring accountability mechanisms are in place. We recognize that co-creation is a long-term process of relationship- and trust-building."
