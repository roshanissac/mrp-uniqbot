Ted Rogers School of Management,Business Management,Deregistration,What Is deregistration  in Business Management program?,https://www.torontomu.ca/tedrogersschool/business-management/faqs/#accordion-content-1551976249332-what-is-deregistration-,"Deregistration is the removal of a student from classes by his or her School for a semester for failing to meet the requirements which the university makes a pre-condition of being allowed to register for courses. Deregistered students can earn no credit towards their degree in that semester.

Deregistration happens in the Ted Rogers School of Business Management when probationary students do not have their Plan of Study for a particular semester approved by the School. Since they have failed to comply with the University's requirement that probationary students ""may not continue their program studies until a specific plan for studies has been authorized by their program School or Department and recorded with the Registrar"", and since they have failed to have a probationary plan of studies (i.e. probationary contract) approved by their program department, the Ted Rogers School of Business Management has students' course enrolments and course intention requests cancelled for the term in question."

However, courses can be taken for other, non-degree credit reasons, such as for interest, to practice improving study skills, or to complete a certificate."
Ted Rogers School of Management,Business Management,Deregistration,Are deregistration and being 'Required To Withdraw' the same thing  for Business Management program?,https://www.torontomu.ca/tedrogersschool/business-management/faqs/#accordion-content-1551976300096-are-deregistration-and-being--required-to-withdraw--the-same-thing-,"No, they are very different, although in both cases the students are out of school for a determined period of time and receive no credit toward their degree for any courses taken during that time.

Deregistration is not an Academic Standing like Probation or being Required to Withdraw. It is the administrative action taken when students on probation fail to comply with the university's requirement that they should have their courses approved (i.e. a probationary contract). Deregistered students are still in the program on probation; they are simply not allowed to register for a semester. Their transcript will show only that they took no courses that semester; it will not indicate why. Deregistered students are not required to follow any program nor, since they are still in the program, to apply for reinstatement. Space is guaranteed for them in the following semester, as it is for all students who are not on Required to Withdraw, and course selections for the next semester are retained and used to construct their timetables. They are entitled to continue in the following semester, assuming that they have their probationary plan of study approved and their contract signed.

'Required to Withdraw' is an Academic Standing indicating performance that is well below acceptable norms."
Ted Rogers School of Management,Business Management,Deregistration,Don't you think it's very unfair to stop someone from taking courses after they've paid their fees  for Business Management program?,https://www.torontomu.ca/tedrogersschool/business-management/faqs/#accordion-content-1551976358301-don-t-you-think-it-s-very-unfair-to-stop-someone-from-taking-courses-after-they-ve-paid-their-fees-,"Yes, it would be very unfair to do that since it is the Ted Rogers School of Business Management, acting in accordance with the university's requirements, which deregisters the student. That's why the fees for the semester are returned by the university. The Fees Department credits the deregistered student's account as soon as the Ted Rogers School of Business Management sends the Department notice of the deregistration. Continuing Education fees are also credited in the same way. The student may leave the money there to be used the following semester or may make a request in writing to the Fees Department that the fees be returned to them. A cheque is not sent out automatically, partly because students change their residences quite often without notifying Records and partly because, since they are out of School for a semester, deregistered students may return home for the semester to work. The Fees Department wants to be sure that the refund goes to the right place and is not cashed by someone other than the student."
Ted Rogers School of Management,Business Management,Deregistration,Don't you think it's a bit extreme to make a student lose a whole semester just for a technicality  for Business Management program?,https://www.torontomu.ca/tedrogersschool/business-management/faqs/#accordion-content-1551976387165-don-t-you-think-it-s-a-bit-extreme-to-make-a-student-lose-a-whole-semester-just-for-a-technicality-,"Not doing what you must do as a probationary student is not a technicality, it is a serious matter. The Ted Rogers School of Business Management has to set deadlines so that we know what probationary students are doing and whether they are following the requirements approved by Business Council for Probationary students. The probationary students' contracts must be approved as soon as possible so that the students know where they stand and what they are responsible for from the beginning; that's why we try to make that contracts are signed in early June for the Fall semester and as early as possible in the Winter semester.

The Ted Rogers School of Business Management must ensure that the deadlines are enforced so that we know who has complied with the university's requirements. We tried an honour system with the Plans of Study and the contracts before but very few students complied. Many claimed that there were unaware that they had to do so or that they had to meet certain specific requirements. That's why we now make sure that every probationary student is operating under the same rules, and meeting deadlines is part of that. In fact, most probationary students are very responsible about meeting their deadlines. It would be very unfair if those who do not feel they should be subject to the same requirements as others, or who don't bother to find out what they must do on probation, were to be rewarded for their lack of responsibility."

If a student is not sure what to do to ensure this, or doesn't think that they were responsible for going on probation, they should make an appointment with the Academic advisor to discuss the situation. A full/part-time job will also provide new and useful perspectives which will help the student focus on studying, especially if it leads to a new career direction, when they return to school."
