What about Housing and Residence Life’s Community Standards?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nToronto Met’s Student Code of Non-Academic Conduct is the university’s policy that outlines what is considered non-academic misconduct. Non-academic offences includes behaviours that are threatening, intimidating or abusive; the theft, destruction or damage to property; or disruption to the learning and teaching environment. The Academic Code of Conduct - what is commonly referred to as Policy 60 - deals exclusively with academic integrity and conduct \\xa0that includes plagiarism, cheating, submission of false information.\\nStudents who live in a Toronto Met residence (such as Pitman Hall or the ILLC) are also expected to abide by the clear expectations of acceptable behaviour as a member of a residence community; these expectations are written in Housing and Residence Life’s Community Standards.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            Who can file a complaint under the Code?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAny Toronto Met student, faculty or staff can lodge a complaint against a Toronto Met student under the Student Code of Non-Academic Conduct.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                             Can I be found responsible for violating the Code if the incident occurred off-campus?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYes, the Code applies to student behaviour off-campus if you are publicly representing Toronto Met; participating in a course or organized class activity; attending an off-campus Toronto Met event; or your behaviour is negatively impacting another Toronto Met community member’s ability to learn, study, work or teach. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                             I received a letter from the Student Conduct Officer.

(lectures, labs and tutorials to name a few). this is a time for you to explore the different opportunities and resources that exist at the ted rogers school of management and toronto metropolitan university.\\nyour first year in the program will be a general year where you take several introductory courses that expose you to the different subject areas. this will prepare you for the rest of your studies and help you decide on what you would like to major in. the school of business management is made up of seven unique majors. your major is the subject area that you specialize in, meaning

deregistration\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nopen all close all\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what is deregistration?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nderegistration is the removal of a student from classes by his or her school for a semester for failing to meet the requirements which the university makes a pre-condition of being allowed to register for courses. deregistered students can earn no credit towards their degree in that semester.\\nderegistration happens in the ted rogers school of business management when probationary students do not have their plan of study for a particular semester approved by the school. since they have failed to comply with the university\\'s requirement that probationary students \"may not continue their program studies until a specific plan for studies has been authorized by their program school or department and recorded with the registrar\", and since they have failed to have a probationary plan of studies (i.e. probationary contract) approved by their program department, the ted rogers school of business management has students\\' course enrolments and course intention requests cancelled for the term in question.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            can deregistered students take continuing education courses instead?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe restriction also applies to courses taken through continuing education or, indeed at any other institution, while a student is deregistered. however, courses can be taken for other, non-degree credit reasons, such as for interest, to practice improving study skills, or to complete a certificate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            are deregistration and being \\'required to withdraw\\' the same thing?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nno, they are very different, although in both cases the students are out of school for a determined period of time and receive no credit toward their degree for any courses taken during that time.\\nderegistration is not an academic standing like probation or being required to withdraw. it is the administrative action taken when students on probation fail to comply with the university\\'s requirement that they should have their courses approved (i.e. a probationary contract). deregistered students are still in the program on probation; they are simply not allowed to register for a semester. their transcript will show only that they took no courses that semester; it will not indicate why. deregistered students are not required to follow any program nor, since they are still in the program, to apply for reinstatement. space is guaranteed for them in the following semester, as it is for all students who are not on required to withdraw, and course selections for the next semester are retained and used to construct their timetables. they are entitled to continue in the following semester, assuming that they have their probationary plan of study approved and their contract signed.\\n\\'required to withdraw\\'\\xa0(opens in new window)\\xa0 is an academic standing indicating performance that is well below acceptable norms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            don\\'t you think it\\'s very unfair to stop someone from taking courses after they\\'ve paid their fees?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyes, it would be very unfair to do that since it is the ted rogers school of business management, acting in accordance with the university\\'s requirements, which deregisters the student. that\\'s why the fees for the semester are returned by the university. the fees department credits the deregistered student\\'s account as soon as the ted rogers school of business management sends the department notice of the deregistration. continuing education fees are also credited in the same way. the student may leave the money there to be used the following semester or may make a request in writing to the fees department that the fees be returned to them. a cheque is not sent out automatically, partly because students change their residences quite often without notifying records and partly because, since they are out of school for a semester, deregistered students may return home for the semester to work. the fees department wants to be sure that the refund goes to the right place and is not cashed by someone other than the student.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            don\\'t you think it\\'s a bit extreme to make a student lose a whole semester just for a technicality?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnot doing what you must do as a probationary student is not a technicality, it is a serious matter. the ted rogers school of business management has to set deadlines so that we know what probationary students are doing and whether they are following the requirements approved by business council for probationary students. the probationary students\\' contracts must be approved as soon as possible so that the students know where they stand and what they are responsible for from the beginning; that\\'s why we try to make that contracts are signed in early june for the fall semester and as early as possible in the winter semester.\\nthe ted rogers school of business management must ensure that the deadlines are enforced so that we know who has complied with the university\\'s requirements. we tried an honour system with the plans of study and the contracts before but very few students complied. many claimed that there were unaware that they had to do so or that they had to meet certain specific requirements. that\\'s why we now make sure that every probationary student is operating under the same rules, and meeting deadlines is part of that. in fact, most probationary students are very responsible about meeting their deadlines. it would be very unfair if those who do not feel they should be subject to the same requirements as others, or who

graduates who have completed a university degree in addition to their college diploma are eligible for admission.\\nif you have completed a graduate degree, you are still required to submit proof of completion of a 4-year undergraduate degree with a minimum grade of b (73%) in the last two years of studies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            will there be an

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngenerally, we begin to make decisions starting in early spring. offers of admission begin mid-to-late-march and continue throughout the spring and often well into the summer. we will continue to evaluate applications until the program has filled all available spaces for the fall.\\n please feel free to check in with the program directly before you apply to confirm if we are still considering applications.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            can i get transfer credits?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwe are unable to evaluate transcripts for transfer credits before the student has been admitted to the program. please keep in mind that the mscm program is thesis based, not course based. you are required to pay a fixed tuition amount every term you are in the program and that tuition does not depend on how many courses you are enrolled in. as such, transferring one course is not going to have an impact on tuition. there is a chance that some of the elective courses required by our program could be replaced by a transferred course, but this would need an approval from your supervisor and the program director. to do this, the students must fill out the \"transfer credit application form\" from yeates school of graduate and postdoctoral studies, and submit all relevant documents (course outline, assignments, projects etc.). this process can only take place once you are already a toronto met student.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            is there a part-time option?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe mscm program is available as a full-time degree only. the graduate-level work-load is heavy and you may be required to attend courses at different times throughout the day. we strongly recommend that you do not attempt to work full-time while pursuing this degree.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            can you look at my transcript? am i eligible? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nno one at the program level has the required training to be able to evaluate transcripts. the transcripts are reviewed by admissions officers at the yeates school of graduate and postdoctoral studies before the applications are forwarded to the program for review. admissions officers will not perform pre-assessments of applications. if you think you meet the admissions requirements outlined here you are eligible to apply. you can learn more about how ysgps calculates gpa. meeting the minimum eligibility guarantees that your application will be reviewed by the program, but it does not guarantee admission. the applicant pools vary each year, so what might be a successful application one year, may not necessarily be successful the following year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            do you have gpa statistics on previously admitted students?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nour cohorts are small and the applicants are considered based on their entire application package, which includes their letter of intent with research potential, cv, reference letters, etc. finding a good supervisor as a match also strengthens the applications. as such, the gpa is not a good indicator of what makes a successful application.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncontact us\\nemail \\uf0e0\\nmscm@torontomu.ca\\naddress \\uf041\\xa0\\nsite location:\\n575 bay street (entrance at 55 dundas

your osap funding to be deposited into your\\xa0myservicehub and/or bank account.\\nif 10 business days have passed since your enrolment was confirmed, and your funding has not been deposited, please

what impact does dropping courses have on my osap assessment?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfull-time osap applicants\\n*note: there is no need to notify the student financial assistance (sfa) office if you drop a course(s). the sfa office automatically makes relevant adjustments to your osap application for you throughout each semester. please note there are possible implications to your osap when dropping courses, such as funding overpayments, possible reduction in future funding installments in the same academic year, and/or being placed on osap academic probation.\\nif you drop one or more courses but remain in a full-time course load, you will remain eligible for osap but may see a decrease in your funding assessment.\\nif you drop to a part-time course load or withdraw from all your courses, you will lose osap eligibility for the rest of the semester and you will likely see a decrease in your funding assessment.\\nnote: once six months lapse since you were last in a full-time course load and received osap, you will enter repayment. if you drop to a part-time course load but take a full-time course load again within six months and apply for either osap or continuation of interest-free status, repayment will not occur.\\ndropping courses always poses a risk of having osap overpayments, grant to loan conversion, and being placed on osap academic probation.\\npart-time osap applicants\\n*note: there is no need to notify the student financial assistance (sfa) office if you drop a course(s). the sfa office automatically makes relevant adjustments to your osap application for you throughout each semester.\\xa0\\nif you drop one or more courses during a term that you received part-time osap, you will be required to self-fund for the next semester during which you apply for part-time osap and\\xa0pass all the courses you take that semester.\\nexample: during the fall 2021 term, you receive part-time osap and then drop one course. you apply and receive full-time osap during the winter 2022 term. you then re-apply for part-time osap during the fall 2022 term - you will need to self-fund during the fall 2022 term.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how can i reset my osap password and/or retrieve my osap access number (oan)?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\noan password resets can be done in person or virtually:\\n\\nin-person: you can do an oan or password reset at any public college or university in ontario. you do not have to complete it at the institution you attended. if you opt to come in person at tmu, we offer oan or password reset on a walk-in basis through the servicehub.\\nvirtual: we offer limited virtual oan or password resets by appointment via google meet. you must have clear and available camera access to conduct a virtual appointment. to set up an appointment, please contact the servicehub directly.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            is my course load calculated by billing units or by enrolled courses?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfor osap purposes, your course load is determined based on the number of billings units associated with your enrolment.\\nat tmu, each course has an assigned billing unit (which allows us to determine your course load calculation for osap purposes). most courses at\\xa0tmu count as one billing unit.\\xa0\\nhowever, there are some courses that count as multiple billing units. the number of billing units is determined separately from the grade point average (gpa) weight/academic unit.  for osap purposes, each billing unit is equal to a 20% course load. for example, if you are taking one course that is weighted at three billing units, then you would have a 60% course load (three billing units x 20%).\\xa0\\ntherefore, in this scenario, you would be eligible to apply for\\xa0full-time osap. to see how many billing units a course is worth, please refer to your academic program section of the undergraduate calendar. the screenshot below shows an example of a course that counts as multiple billing units.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthis screenshot shows that one course (mwf 120) counts for five billing units.\\xa0\\nfor osap purposes, since the course is equivalent to five courses, you would be considered a full-time osap student at a 100% course load (five billing units x 20%).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            i added or dropped a course after my osap was confirmed. do i need to report this to the university?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwe encourage students to finalize their course load promptly before the start of term to avoid delays in their osap funding disbursements.\\nyou do not need to notify the university if your course load changed as a result of you adding or dropping courses unless a staff member has advised you to do so.\\xa0\\nthe sfa office audits students’ course loads regularly throughout each semester to identify course load changes and adjusts osap applications accordingly.\\xa0 if your adjusted course load results in any additional funding, it will automatically be released to the student. for information on the impacts of dropping a course, visit\\xa0“what impact does dropping courses have on my osap assessment?”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n

non-academic conduct is the university’s policy that outlines what is considered non-academic misconduct. non-academic offences includes behaviours that are threatening, intimidating or abusive; the theft, destruction or damage to property; or disruption to the learning and teaching environment. the academic code of conduct - what is commonly referred to as policy 60 - deals exclusively with academic integrity and conduct \\xa0that includes plagiarism, cheating, submission of false information.\\nstudents who live in a toronto met residence (such as pitman hall or the illc) are also expected to abide by the clear expectations of acceptable behaviour as a member of a residence community; these expectations are written in housing and residence life’s community standards.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            who can file a complaint under the code?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nany toronto met student,

responsible for violating the code if the incident occurred off-campus?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyes, the code applies to student behaviour off-campus if you are publicly representing toronto met; participating in a course or organized class activity; attending an off-campus toronto met event; or your behaviour is negatively impacting another toronto met community member’s ability to learn, study, work or teach. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                             i received a letter from the student conduct officer. what should i

social ventures zone provide?\\nwho can apply to the social ventures zone?\\nhow are projects selected for the social ventures zone?\\nhow do i apply?\\nhow much does it cost to join the social ventures zone?\\nhow much time do i need to commit to participate in the social ventures zone?\\nwhere is the social ventures zone located?\\nwhat if i don’t have a good idea but want to get involved?\\n\\xa0\\nwhat is the social ventures zone?\\nthe social ventures zone was founded in 2014 by the toronto metropolitan university faculty of arts, building on the rich history of world-changing ideas and approaches from the humanities and social sciences. \\xa0it was designed as a place where teams of students, alumni, and innovators from the community could develop viable social enterprises that positively impact social issues.\\nthe overall aim of the social ventures zone is to develop and incubate the next generation of innovative and sustainable solutions to canada’s most pressing social challenges. \\xa0as they develop their social enterprises, team’s progress along a continuum of learning that will give them the entrepreneurial skills and work experience necessary for whatever their future might hold.\\nwhat support does the social ventures zone provide?\\nmore than a co-working space, the social ventures zone is a community of innovators from a variety of backgrounds and disciplines who are supported by coaching, training sessions, incubation space, peer-to-peer connections and other community resources. \\xa0alex gill, our social innovator in residence, provides overall direction and support to venture teams, backed by a team of community coaches and the peer support and encouragement from the other teams. \\xa0innovators can also engage a growing roster of subject matter experts drawn from toronto metropolitan's faculty, giving them on-demand access to the most up-to-date knowledge and research about their social issues.\\nwho can apply to the social ventures zone?\\nfrom big to small and local to global, we’re looking for creative ideas and ventures that have the promise of sustainability and impact. toronto metropolitan university undergraduate and graduate students (or alumni) from any faculty – or innovators from the broader community – can apply with their idea.\\nhow are projects selected for the social ventures zone?\\nindividuals or venture teams can apply with their social enterprise by completing an online application form. \\xa0our admissions committee is made up of faculty, staff, fellow entrepreneurs, and community members and meets each semester (three times per year) to evaluate ventures requesting admission. \\xa0each application is blindly scored according to the following criteria:\\npotential impact: \\xa0\\xa0how will the venture impact people or the environment, address a serious concern and/or have a potential to engage community partners?\\ndegree of innovation: \\xa0to what degree does the venture idea mimic established approaches or does it present a new and innovative approach (and the potential for disruptive change)?\\npotential of sustainability: \\xa0has the individual or team thought through how the venture can be viable (e.g. multiple sources of revenue, support of a partner, etc)?\\npersonal capacity: \\xa0does the team lead and/or team members have a demonstrated history of self-starting, a passion for the issue, etc.?\\nafter the admissions committee reviews and evaluates the online application, it may choose one of two (2) options:\\n\\ndecide not to accept the application and recommend other courses of action to improve the idea for resubmission, suggest other places it can find support, etc.; or, \\noffer stage one approval and ask the individual and/or team proponent(s) to attend an in-person pitch session with committee members \\n\\nproponents who are asked to pitch in person should prepare a basic slide deck (no more than ten slides) explaining their project and why it is a good fit for the social ventures zone. \\xa0each pitch should be no more than ten minutes long and will then be followed by up to 15 minutes of questions from the committee. \\xa0for an example of a template presentation, check out guy kawasaki’s pitch guidelines\\xa0(external link)\\xa0.\\xa0\\nin the event that the venture is not accepted, the committee will provide the proponents with feedback as to why and make suggestions, as appropriate, for further work on the concept, other places they may go for support, etc.\\nwhat makes an application to the social ventures zone successful?\\nthe social ventures zone receives dozens of applications for each round of admissions and our admissions committee selects the ones that best fit the criteria for admission. but in addition to the criteria outlined above, we often receive applications that are rejected because they fall into the following categories:\\n\\nventures that are not true social ventures, but rather businesses that have some social aspect. \\xa0for example, if your idea is to build a new dating app but donate a portion of proceeds to charity, that does not meet our definition of a social venture because it does not have a social issue at the core of its operations. \\ninnovators who do not sufficiently support their idea. \\xa0we sometimes receive pitches from innovators who propose what looks like an innovative idea but they do not support it with research, an organizational model or a basic understanding of the population it will help, etc. \\nideas that are better suited to a community group or student club. \\xa0while social progress often comes from the dialogue and connections that happen in groups of volunteers, such groups are not per se a social venture. \\n\\nhow do i apply?\\ninnovators can join the social ventures zone as one of three cohorts we accept each year. to determine whether applications are currently open or when they might be, check here.\\nshould you have questions or need assistance completing the application, you are welcome to call 416-979-5000 ext. 7255 or email socialventures@torontomu.ca.\\nhow much does it cost to join the social ventures zone?\\nthere is no cost involved to apply to the social ventures zone and successful ventures are not charged a fee once accepted. \\xa0ventures accepted into the zone are provided with free access to resources, professional advice, funding opportunities, skill development, and ongoing mentorship from successful community innovators and social entrepreneurs.\\nhow much time do i need to commit to participate in the social ventures zone?\\nventure team members are expected to contribute a minimum of 10-12 hours per month to their social enterprise. \\xa0this includes your participation in workshops and modules, time dedicated to your venture, and ongoing peer-to-peer collaboration.\\non that note, we believe in helping, not holding back. while focus is a good thing, we know that innovators sometimes need encouragement. \\xa0they need to know others believe in them and can pitch in to help, when needed. \\xa0that is why we want the social ventures zone to be a space where we actively look for opportunities to help our fellow innovators when we see them facing a challenge. \\xa0because what we give, we get back.\\nwhere is the social ventures zone located?\\nwe are located at 40 gould street, kerr hall south 45 (khs 045). you can find the entrance under the arches across from balzac’s on gould street.\\nwhat if i don’t have a good idea but want to get involved?\\nthe social ventures zone offers a supportive environment for ideas that are at least partially formed, have a team and are ready to put more work into moving their venture forward. \\xa0but we welcome people whose idea is still in the early stages or who would like to learn more about social enterprise, entrepreneurship and community change. \\xa0we offer the following opportunities to:\\n\\ndevelop ideas and formulate a plan through degree credit courses such as ssh400.\\xa0 \\n\\n\\njoin an ideation cohort at the zone and develop your initial idea into a pitch-worthy one! \\xa0each term, we accept a small number of innovators who want to improve their ideas through a regular series of ideation sessions. \\xa0for more information, contact socialventures@torontomu.ca \\n\\n\\nget inspired at special events, speakers’ series, and workshops hosted across campus. check out\\xa0zone learning\\xa0and the office of social

and a microcosm of what communities will look like across canada in the future.\\xa0\\nwe are building this medical school with the communities it will serve. brampton residents, community agencies and health partners have all provided unwavering support in project approvals, planning, and development so we will be ready to welcome our first cohort of medical students and residents in 2025.\\xa0\\nbrampton’s population has increased rapidly and the region’s growth has been shaped by immigration. it is also a region of the province that has been chronically underfunded and has been hit by a higher rate of occurrence of covid-19.\\nin addition, brampton and toronto metropolitan university have existing partnerships through several initiatives, including the cybersecure catalyst, and brampton ventures zone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            where in brampton will the school of medicine be located? why was this location chosen?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe bramalea civic centre in brampton-peel has been selected as the future site of tmu's school of medicine.\\nthe bramalea civic centre was chosen for its proximity to both the brampton civic and peel memorial hospitals as well as its accessibility to municipal transportation, go transit and highway systems the site is also close to a variety of services and amenities to support the needs and well-being of our students, faculty and staff; it provides ready access to green space and active transportation infrastructure, such as walking and biking trails. \\nthe site also meets the space requirements to build a school of medicine that will require 250,000 square feet for classrooms, offices, research facilities and an integrated health clinic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            why is toronto metropolitan university interested in a medical school?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntoronto metropolitan university believes it can offer a new approach to medical education in ontario — one that draws on the university’s commitment to community, diversity and inclusion, and innovation to address the changing needs for health care delivery and practice.\\nbuilding on the strength and foundation of deep and broad community and industry partnerships, tmu is ideally situated to shape the future of health care. the university’s new approach to medical education will meet the current pain points in the healthcare system, which have been exacerbated by the global pandemic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            does toronto metropolitan university have the expertise and academic programming experience needed to open a medical school?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntoronto metropolitan university is known for its focus on excellence in health across various faculties and departments. for example, the academic programs in areas such as psychology, nursing, social work, occupational health and safety, midwifery, biomedical engineering, physics (medical physics) and biology and chemistry are all major contributors to the university’s regional and national presence in the health field based on their magnitude of research and their undergraduate and graduate enrolments. a new school of medicine will build on this foundation of excellence and leadership in health education.\\ntmu is distinctly solutions-oriented, demonstrated through its teaching, research and community partnerships. the university is deeply engaged with unity health and with st michael's hospital, where its labs in the hospital’s research wing support on-site collaboration between clinical needs and bio-engineering know-how. the institute of biomedical engineering, science and technology\\xa0(external link)\\xa0 (ibest), the biomedical zone (bmz), and the medtech talent accelerator,\\xa0(external

                       is toronto metropolitan university partnering with any hospital in brampton?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwilliam osler health system\\xa0(external

training and professional development.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how will the school of medicine address equity, diversity and inclusion (edi)?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nequity, diversity and inclusion (edi) and reconciliation will be intentionally infused throughout all facets of the tmu school of medicine, including:

activities;\\xa0\\nenterprise; and\\xa0\\npatient, family, and community engagement.\\xa0\\n\\nwe will continually foster a culture of inclusion and engagement and advance social justice. the tmu school of medicine will be the first medical school in canada founded and intentionally built upon the foundations of social accountability, edi and reconciliation.\\xa0\\nto facilitate the integration of edi into all aspects of the planning and program development process, a school of medicine edi advisory committee was established to create an edi strategy and action plan. the resulting plan has also been endorsed by the academic program development committee\\xa0 \\nthis work is also guided by the school of medicine’s equity, diversity and inclusion values statement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how will the school of medicine address truth and reconciliation?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na vital component of the truth and reconciliation process is public recognition of the tragic and painful history and the ongoing impacts of residential schools.\\nour university has been on its own path of truth and reconciliation with the work of the \\xa0(pdf file)\\xa0standing strong task force. as a starting point, we draw inspiration from the \\xa0(pdf file)\\xa0truth and reconciliation

through 24 are the most relevant to medical school contexts. in particular, they address the need for indigenous understandings of health and well-being, a holistic admissions process and the creation of pathway programs for indigenous learners.\\nin addition, the association of faculties of medicine of canada’s indigenous working group has provided a crucial roadmap for the implementation of the truth and reconciliation commission calls to action in their \\xa0(pdf file)\\xa0joint commitment to action on indigenous health\\xa0(external link)\\xa0. their report highlights the importance of accountability and of thoughtful, reciprocal relationships with indigenous communities to advance reconciliation and indigenous health.\\nboth documents serve as an important reminder of the need to form respectful, reciprocal, long-term relationships with indigenous-led organizations early in the planning process to set the foundation for a meaningful commitment to action. the university is committed to developing meaningful relationships with indigenous communities through a co-creation approach to define the terms of the relationship and ensuring accountability mechanisms are in place. we recognize that co-creation is a long-term process of relationship- and trust-building.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            when will the school of medicine open?\\r\\n

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nafter broad community engagement and extensive research, the university’s standing strong (mash koh wee kah pooh win) task force recommended that the university be renamed to better align with institutional values.\\xa0\\nthe recommendation and subsequent decision to rename was not based on a vilification of egerton ryerson but instead was based on the understanding that a new name is necessary to create a more inclusive campus culture and environment. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how did the university go about the renaming process?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfollowing the board of governors' august 2021 decision to accept the standing strong task force recommendations, president lachemi announced our commitment to determining a new name by the end of the 2021/22 academic year. to reach this goal, the university renaming advisory committee (urac) was established.\\xa0\\nin april 2022, the urac concluded their community and expert informed process and submitted a shortlist of possible names for president lachemi’s consideration. after careful deliberation, one of the names was recommended to the board of governors for approval.\\xa0\\nfor more information on the renaming process, please visit the university renaming\\xa0webpage.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how long will it take for the new name to be fully integrated?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhile the new name - toronto metropolitan university - was adopted and registered immediately upon approval by the board of governors on april 26, 2022, the overall transition to the new name is happening in phases.\\xa0\\xa0\\nsome university materials changed immediately, such as webpages and social media handles, while other changes, such as external signage on campus buildings and amendments to legal documents, including degrees, will take longer.\\nthe ontario legislature voted to amend the\\xa0ryerson university act\\xa0on december 1, 2022, allowing the new name to be reflected on legal documents issued by the university.\\non december 8, 2022 the amendment received royal assent from the lieutenant governor, legally changing our university’s name to toronto metropolitan university.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n

need to get rid of ryerson branded items that still have value or are of use to you, the branded materials transition project provides the opportunity for community members to drop off their unwanted branded items to be reused, upcycled or recycled. visit the\\xa0project website\\xa0for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            does the university have a new mascot?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfollowing iterative community engagement to reconsider the former mascot, eggy the ram, the university announced that a new mascot and team name would be determined. on august 29, 2022 the new team, tmu bold, along with plans for the development of a falcon mascot were announced. new athletic uniforms and the new mascot will be debuted in early 2023.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            has the name of the university act changed? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyes,

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyour hard-earned degree remains an accomplishment to celebrate, and a credential worthy of promotion. alumni are certainly encouraged to keep and display their old degrees with pride, if they are comfortable doing so.\\xa0\\nthe university understands that not all alumni may want to keep their degree issued under our former name. alumni who wish to have their degree reissued under our new name can do so. this is a service the university has always offered and alumni will continue to have this option now that we have been renamed toronto metropolitan university.\\xa0\\nmore details on this will be posted to the curriculum advising webpage when available.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how should i refer to my

with the option to use either ryerson university or the new university name when listing their education. for current alumni, ryerson will be the default under their school information, but linkedin members will be able to switch manually to the new name a few days following the announcement. further instructions will follow on the steps required to make this manual

child.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            2. how do midwives in ontario work?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmidwives usually work in community\\xadbased group practices. they attend births in hospitals, at client's homes, and in birth centres. they provide care throughout pregnancy, labour, birth and up to six weeks postpartum to the client and their baby.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            3. do i need to be a nurse before i can become a midwife?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nno. midwifery is an autonomous profession separate and distinct from nursing and medicine. while there are basic skills that are common to all three professions, midwifery has a unique scope of practice and model of care.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            4. what type of educational background do students who are accepted to the program typically have?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmidwifery students come from a wide variety of educational backgrounds. many of them have received previous university undergraduate degrees while others have graduate degrees, college diplomas, or are mature students. prospective students are strongly recommended to have completed a minimum of one year of university education.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            5. what are my chances of acceptance into the program with little or no experience in the health field?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npast experience may be taken into account during the selection process, but it is by no means a necessary requirement for acceptance into the program. applicants are assessed for those qualities that will enable the individual to become a good midwife.\\xa0 places in the program have been offered to applicants from many different walks of life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            6. what is the earning potential for a midwife in ontario?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nplease consult the association of ontario midwives for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            7. what is the employment outlook for students on completing the program?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwith demand for midwives exceeding supply, there are many opportunities for graduates to fill positions in ontario and other provinces in canada. once students complete the program, they must write the canadian midwifery registration exam (cmre) and then they are eligible to apply to the college of midwives of ontario for registration and are required to work in an established midwifery practice for one year. toronto metropolitan university graduates have successfully found positions in midwifery practices across ontario and other parts of canada.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            8. what's the philosophy of the program?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe educational program is based on the following beliefs and values:  we believe that midwifery has the potential to be one of the most important components of women’s health care in ontario. midwives’ expertise in the care of normal pregnancy and childbirth arises from their understanding of childbearing as a social, cultural and biological process and from their ability to competently exercise clinical skills and decision\\xad-making. midwifery education must provide the base for sound professional practice.  we believe that midwives are the best persons to teach the professional practice of midwifery. in addition we believe that the educational program has a special responsibility to foster partnerships between midwives and other health care providers for the benefit of students and women who seek midwifery care.  we believe the educational program is an integral part of the evolution of the profession of midwifery in ontario and canada. the program must help create future leaders and teachers. it must establish practice and teaching as a continuum so that learning environments become available across ontario.  we believe the educational program will best assure the acquisition of knowledge, skills and values, and foster critical thinking if the academic setting is respectful of students, is committed to scholarly enquiry and emphasized the lifelong ability to learn and change.  we believe that accessible education, which is both flexible and culturally sensitive, requires high quality distance education.  we believe that the collaborative model of program development and management described herein provides both a reflection of and a model for professional practice in the field of midwifery.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            9. where can i find the supplementary application form used in midwifery?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin addition to meeting the competitive academic requirements for the program, mep applicants are required to submit the midwifery self-id and admissions survey. the survey is used to gather information on applicants' clinical placement region preferences and their desire to participate in the voluntary equity admissions self-id and/or indigenous admissions processes. the survey is due by february 1st and is access through an applicant's choosetmu applicant portal\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n    quick links\\r\\n

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyour account has unlimited storage. you\\'ll probably never run out of space. in fact, a heavy email user who sends and receives lots of file attachments and archives all messages might use up to 5% of this space a year (usually less), so it would take decades to use up all of the available space. also note that google apps restricts the size of file attachments to 20

to save you time and prevent clutter. the message will appear in your inbox if someone responds to it or if there is an error delivering the message. if you would like to view your message, you can

a\\xa0single\\xa0message, click\\xa0forward\\xa0(from the drop-menu at the top of the message). if it\\'s attached to a message in a\\xa0conversation, click\\xa0forward all\\xa0on the right.\\ndelete

sheets add-ons are not available?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngoogle has launched a new menu of services called “add-ons for docs and sheets”. add-ons are applications created by third-parties (non-google and non-tmu) and have the ability to interact with your google apps for edu account (your tmu gmail, calendar and google drive, and other google apps for edu services). \\nindividuals cannot turn on the ability to install these services. they must either be enabled for everyone by tmu or for no one. working with the privacy and security officers, ccs has been investigating whether these services should be enabled at tmu. \\neach add-on requires the person who used it to agree to permissions such as granting the third party the ability to view and manage your email or send email on your behalf.\\n the third parties also have separate terms of service from tmu’s contract with google. this means that these applications are not covered by our agreement with google, which raises privacy, security, legal and records management concerns. \\xa0\\nit also means that the privacy and security requirements we have established for the core google apps for edu services may not be met by these third-party applications. \\nfor example, while testing, we discovered that some of these applications do not support tmu’s expectation of “privacy as a default setting,” one of the seven principles of\\xa0privacy by design\\xa0(external link)\\xa0. \\nas a result of all of these risk factors, we have decided not to enable the ability to install add-ons in google apps for edu at tmu.\\nplease note that by design from google, tmu users will always see the “add-ons” menu while in a google doc or spreadsheet and while users can browse these add-ons, they will not be able to install and use them since tmu’s google apps administrators in ccs have not enabled this service for tmu.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n    import

(cas) as our single sign on (sso) solution. it’s used to access my.torontomu portal, google apps for tmu and many other web applications. \\xa0for security reasons and to help mitigate phishing attacks, it is important that users are able to view the url of the cas login page in the browser address bar. hence, we do not allow cas login page to be embedded in other web pages, for example, via an inline frame (iframe). and we have mechanism in place to break out of embedded pages such as iframes. \\xa0in such cases, you will get \\xa0\"authentication required\" cas page.\\nsites often embed google technologies in them, such as google calendar, google forms \\xa0and google maps etc. \\xa0some of these want to retrieve your google data (your avatar, gmail address etc), so google tries to authenticate you. \\xa0depends on your google authentication session, if it has timed out, you will be redirected to google login page. \\xa0if you’ve used google apps for tmu, you will be redirected to cas login page. \\xa0as these all happened in the embedded iframe, cas breaks out of the frame and present you with the \"authentication required\" page.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            i have gone to my.torontomu.ca and logged in. when i click the \"manage my resources...\" i do not have the

can be useful for holding online meetings when in-person meetings aren’t possible. in google meet, you can also dial in or dial out using a phone to join meetings (you will only have voice capabilities in the dial in/out option). video calls are similar to other tools available at tmu such as zoom, with comparable features. if you have a camera and microphone for your computer or device, you can start a video call with up to 500 participants and share your screen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what happened to video calls in hangouts?\\r\\n

as grades on tests and papers. you should not provide a third party with any personal information. you also do not need to provide such things as exam questions, teaching materials or research notes, as these are excluded. if you have a question you may contact tmu’s privacy officer at\\xa0fippa@torontomu.ca. if you choose not to honour a request for information, the requestor has a right to file

requested and to determine if any exclusions or exemptions apply. fees are charged to the requestor for the time taken to search for and, if appropriate, prepare records for release.\\xa0 if the

apply to records that are personal to you (including business activities unrelated to the university). however, if you don’t keep those records separate from your university records, it is possible that confusion could occur as to what is actually the university’s and what is yours. a best practice is to keep these separate and clearly mark those files that do not belong to the university (e.g. separate file cabinet, separate folders on computer and email).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q10: what types of student and general records do i need to retain and

disposed of when no longer needed: \\n\\nduplicate stocks of publications, printed literature or blank forms, including those associated with computer-based information systems;\\nduplicate records within the same media retained solely for convenient reference or future distribution (examples include branch-wide memos; \"all staff\" e-mails; notices of holidays, special events or routine administrative matters; and personal desk copies of such items as program studies or committee minutes);\\nbroadly distributed materials (such as manuals, directives, bulletins and guidelines) used to communicate policies and practices for internal administration (other than original copies kept by the office from which the materials were issued);\\nphone messages, personal messages, and records documenting activities such as holiday parties or charitable fund drives unconnected to program functions; \\nunsolicited advertising materials;\\npublications such as books, journals, magazines, newspapers, newsletters, and published reports which form or will form part of a library\\'s catalogued holdings or are stored within branch libraries or reference shelves;\\npublication extracts which have no significant value in documenting how program data was collected or decisions reached, and which have not therefore been integrated within program files;\\ntemporary working papers such as rough notes or informal drafts that are of no value in documenting data collection or in showing how tmu policies or programs were developed or implemented. (that is, they represent no significant steps in the preparation of a final document, were not reviewed by other persons, do not record program decisions, and do not contain important research or background data.)\\nmanagers should ensure that all transitory items are deleted or destroyed immediately when no longer needed.\\n\\n official tmu records \\nofficial records are distinct from transitory records. official records serve important business functions, such as supporting program delivery or policy development, or meeting legal, financial and other needs. they may also provide important evidence of institutional decisions and actions. these should only be destroyed in accordance with with tmu’s record retention schedule (see\\xa0records management policy).\\nrecords containing personal information \\nanything which has personal information must be retained for a minimum of one year under fippa. personal information includes, but is not limited to: name, home address, home phone number, student’s email address (home or tmu), identifying numbers (e.g. student number, employee number or social insurance number), education history (grades, degrees received, academic misconduct) health history, or opinions about an individual.\\xa0 your professional contact information is generally not perceived as personal information (faculty’s business phone number, tmu email, business mailing address). see the definition of “personal information” in the freedom of information and protection of privacy act available on the general counsel’s information access and privacy website. \\xa0\\naccording to tmu\\'s\\xa0course management policy 166, all student work is to be returned to the student before the end of the academic term.\\xa0 final exams and unclaimed assignments are the only type of student work that, under fippa, will need to be retained for the one-year period because these are not returned to students.\\xa0\\xa0\\nyou should also retain all

personal about the student beyond their email address (student id, educational or medical history, financial information, questions about course work, evaluations, etc.).\\xa0 this also includes any correspondence that may pertain to an appeal.\\xa0 you should only correspond with students on their “ryerson.ca” email accounts as per tmu’s policy for the\\xa0establishment of student email accounts for official university communication 157.\\nyou should be careful about the content of e-mails as they may be retained not only by you but by others, and they can be requested as part of an foi request. generally, the “reply all” response should be avoided unless it is necessary. you can never be assured of what is retained by others; so, even if you have deleted an email, that’s no guarantee it will not end up being released as a result of an foi request.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q12: can i send multiple students one email using their tmu

address is also a means by which tmu can foster a collaborative learning environment such as through student discussion groups on d2l brightspace.\\xa0 there are no restrictions on how students can use their email address, such as for personal communications, or for communications outside tmu.\\xa0\\nfaculty and staff, however, should take care in using student email addresses.\\xa0 be cautious in sending group emails; disclosing personal information such as grades, internship placements, home contact information, or details about an academic appeal to other students as these situations would all constitute a privacy breach and tmu\\'s privacy officer must be notified immediately.\\xa0\\nif you want to send a group email and the text does not identify individuals, consider using the blind-copying function. refrain from disclosing the student’s email address to non-tmu personnel unless you have the consent of the student.\\xa0\\xa0\\nusing d2l brightspace to post general information messages to students is one low-risk option.\\xa0 for messages aimed at a specific group of students within a course try using the blind-copying function on your email system; this way students can only see their own address and cannot see who else received the message.\\xa0 it is important to note that the content of the message should dictate the method used to communicate information to students; the more sensitive the information, the less appropriate group communication, including email will be.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q13:

           \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstudents who withdraw, discontinue their program, reduce their course load, experience a decline in grades below the minimum cgpa requirement, or no longer meet other scholarship/award requirements, may forfeit all or part of their award. \\nscholarship recipients\\' eligibility is re-evaluated after the add/drop date in each semester (early october for fall, early february for winter) to ensure enrolment conditions continue to be met (i.e. enrolled in an 80% course load). \\nif your scholarship is cancelled, it may result in a charge against your university fee account (myservicehub).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            16. i am switching programs. will i still get my renewal?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyes. your account will still be assessed for renewal even if your program changes, however, it is important to note that scholarships are renewable for three calendar years from the term of admission only (as stated in section 8.5 of the terms and conditions). changing programs does not restart or extend this time

and instructors in order to improve communication, shared expectations, and program coherence.\\neffective program learning outcomes can be observed and/or assessed. rather than describing what the

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfor departments and schools, learning outcomes provide a roadmap for curriculum, and a goal post for student achievement. they serve as essential reference points for academic departments to discuss the elements that contribute to an integrated program of study. the ontario quality framework requires programs to be intentional about the choice and development of their program outcomes and to clearly communicate their roadmap for student learning.\\nfor instructors, program learning outcomes provide a broad picture of the program and offer insights into how each course and other program experiences contribute to the development of the knowledge, skills, and values/attitudes expected of their graduates.\\xa0\\nfor students, program learning outcomes communicate the skills successful graduates will develop, and the types of knowledge they learn in preparation for employment, further education, and to participate as critically informed citizens.\\xa0\\nfor employers, program learning outcomes outline what they can confidently expect from potential employees.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what is the difference between program goals/objectives and program learning outcomes? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe difference between program objectives or goals and program outcomes is a difference in perspective. program goals or objectives are part of the planning process. they describe what a program plans or seeks to achieve. the focus is on what is promoted in and delivered by the program (e.g. broad areas of focus or approach(es), learning activities used, and experiences or opportunities offered). program objectives also help define what makes the program unique and meaningful, and ultimately provide direction and justification for program and course-level curricular decisions.\\nin contrast, program learning outcomes focus on the skills developed by graduates, outlining the knowledge, skills, and values/attitudes that a graduate will be able to demonstrate. rather than focus on the material that will be covered or the experiences they’ll have, program learning outcomes focus on how students understand and employ that material and the specific knowledge, skills and attitudes they will be able to demonstrate as a result.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncomparison of udles, program objectives, program learning outcomes, and course learning outcomes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n swipe to see more

    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nprogram objectives and program learning outcomes are used at toronto metropolitan to guide the design and revision of all academic programs.\\nnew program development\\xa0\\nall new program development involves developing program objectives, and identifying the skills, knowledge and capabilities of the intended graduate,\\xa0 which are then refined into intended program learning outcomes. both the program objectives and the intended program learning outcomes should be developed before planning courses, or laying out the structure for a program. the courses, structures, and course elements should then be designed to provide students with the experiences required to achieve the program’s intended outcomes and to align with the program’s objectives. otherwise, it can be likened to designing a car by providing superb and highly specialized components first, and leaving it to students to make sense of how they may or may not fit together.\\nperiodic program review (ppr)\\nthe ppr process begins with a thorough review of the program objectives and program learning outcomes. program objectives are developed or updated to ensure that there are clear and relevant goals guiding what is promoted in and delivered by the program. program learning outcomes are reviewed and updated to ensure that they are demonstrable and represent the relevant, current, and discipline-specific knowledge, skills, and related attributes expected of program graduates. mapping courses to the program learning outcomes helps identify where and how outcomes are achieved, and supports the review of how the learning is delivered and assessed in the program.\\nmajor curriculum modification(s)\\nany major curriculum modification involves mapping the changes to both the ontario degree-level expectations (dles) and the program learning outcomes to ensure that sufficient coverage is achieved or maintained. mapping the modified curriculum helps to

of all undergraduate and graduate degrees granted by ontario universities. dles indicate the knowledge and skill outcomes, reflecting levels of intellectual and creative development, at specified degree levels (i.e. bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral). dles also help to ensure program learning outcomes are appropriate, degree-graduates meet the expected competencies of the credential, and the quality and value of the credential is comparable across institutions. all ontario universities have agreed to use ocav’s guidelines as a threshold framework for their own degree-level expectations.\\ndles for undergraduate and graduate programs\\xa0(external link)\\xa0\\xa0are delineated into six broad categories:\\n\\ndepth and breadth of knowledge\\nknowledge of methodologies

review should take approximately 18-20 months to complete.\\nstage 1, the preparation of a self-study document by the program, takes approximately 12 months. to facilitate timely completion, the office of the vice provost academic provides resources and support to programs throughout the ppr process.\\nstage 2, which involves reviews, approvals, and a visit from a peer-review team, takes roughly an additional 8 months.\\nthe undergraduate ppr manual includes a \\xa0(google doc)\\xa0recommended timeline\\xa0(external link, opens in new window)\\xa0\\xa0to help programs plan and schedule accordingly for their review. this timeline is mapped to an october start-date, but can be used as a roadmap to schedule ppr sequencing whenever the program chooses to begin its ppr.\\ncontact your curriculum specialist for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what if the program is also scheduled to complete a professional accreditation review? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npprs may be coordinated with any professional accreditation review, if feasible, and accreditation review information can be used to supplement the ppr. however, a self-study and appendices, separate from an accreditation review report, are required since pprs and accreditation reviews have different requirements, purposes, and goals.\\nthe vice-provost academic may require a separate peer review team (prt) when the accrediting body’s assessment does not fully cover all areas required by the university’s ppr process. the ppr prt report must also be a separate document from the accreditation prt report.\\nthe curriculum quality team is available to work with accredited programs to identify areas of overlap and help make the ppr and accreditation complimentary processes. professionally accredited undergraduate programs should consult the vice-provost academic for further guidance and assistance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            who participates in course mapping?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe ppr process should engage all teaching members of the program in the course mapping. once the learning outcomes have been established by the core ppr team of the school/department, all relevant courses to the degree should be mapped accordingly. many programs at tmu rely on cupe 1 contract lecturers for the delivery of compulsory courses. as the ppr process offers programs the opportunity to reflect on current practices, it is therefore important to include course perspectives as taught by cupe 1 contract lecturers.\\nplease note that cupe 1 contract lecturers participating in the course mapping process are to be remunerated as follows: a minimum of 2 hours at $100.00/hour. please note that cupe 1 contract lecturers, either with a teaching contract during this process, or not, are to be invited into the process and paid according to the above guidelines. the mapping work is considered out-of-scope as per articles 17.2 and 17.3 of the unit 1 collective agreement.\\nthe payment can be processed via a \\xa0(pdf file)\\xa0personnel action form. the rationale for the payment must be included on the form. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            who is involved in the ppr self-study?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe ppr is usually led by a small team (made up of faculty, plus administrative support) who are responsible for data collection, analysis, and writing the self-study. however, a successful and effective program review depends on active involvement and support from a range of contributors, including the program director/chair or director of the school/department, curriculum committee, faculty/instructors, students, and the faculty dean.\\nthe office of the vice-provost academic advises programs throughout the review process to ensure that policy requirements are met. each program is assigned a curriculum specialist to provide personalized support and guidance throughout the ppr

production, fashion, interior design, dance and film, the university’s diverse media, design and artistic programs will contribute their courses and faculty expertise to the delivery of the creative industries curriculum. the utilization of these academic resources in combination with the business courses provided by the ted rogers school of management has resulted in a creative curricular design that, unique among canadian undergraduate programs, studies the creative disciplines from the perspective of enterprise development and entrepreneurship and blends artistic, media and communication, cultural and business studies to prepare students for employment opportunities in today’s creative economy.\\nthe first such program of its kind in canada or north america, the creative industries b.a. program has many novel features, including:\\n\\nthe combination of a b.a. degree with a business specialization.\\ncreative-content modules: students will complete two 5-course sequences

backup course\\nlook to see if there is an alternative course that will fulfill the same degree requirement being offered that term. it is always best to get into a backup course and then switch out if a space opens up in the course that you want, rather than run the risk of being left with no course at all.\\xa0\\nwaitlists\\nnot all courses offer a waitlist option, but a lot do. if there is a waitlist, get yourself on to it, and as people drop the course, you will move up the list.\\nmake sure you understand how waitlists work, as every year people try to put themselves onto a waitlist for

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyou may encounter an error message during the course intention selection process. some possible reasons could include:\\n\\nthe course you are trying to add requires “departmental permission”. for courses requiring ‘departmental permission’, you will need to contact the department offering the course during the course intention period to have that course manually added to your intentions. you cannot add the course yourself.\\nrestricted courses: some courses are restricted (i.e. off limits) for some programs during the course intention period. for example, an rta course may be restricted to rta students for the course intentions period. the university will make sure all programs that require the course have first enrolment. only once those students are all in, will any remaining spots become available for general enrolment. this typically happens during the ‘open enrolment period’.\\nthe course you are trying to add is not part of your curriculum and is non-applicable to your degree requirements.\\ntaking courses out of sequence. for example, myservicehub may block enrollment if you try to add a lower level liberal studies (table a) course, which is normally taken during the first two years in the program, to your course intentions selections for third year.\\ncourse prerequisite(s) not met.\\nyou may have a hold on your account that blocks enrollment. an\\xa0account hold\\xa0is a restriction placed on your myservicehub account related to outstanding fees owed or other unresolved obligations with the university. to resolve this hold you

classmates.\\n\\uf0a1\\xa0note: you would see that you\\'re enrolled in the course, but there is no designated timeblock on your schedule due to the asynchronous nature of the course. the course(s)

are split may differ. for example, you could have:\\n\\n3 hour lecture per week.\\n2 hour lecture + 1 hour tutorial per week.\\n2 hour lecture + 1 hour lab per week.\\n\\nthe different class structures offered at tmu are:\\n\\nlecture: depending on the size of the program you are in, there could be anywhere from 15 to 500 students in a lecture. the instructor may incorporate presentations, guest speakers, group participation and many other classroom techniques to encourage student engagement.\\ntutorials: many lectures may have a tutorial scheduled at a different time than the lecture. this breaks down the larger class into smaller groups and encourages discussion and participation. tutorials may be run by the instructor or by a teaching assistant (ta) or graduate assistant (ga).\\nlaboratory (labs): some programs may have labs where you work either individually or in a small group to learn and experiment with the course material in a hands-on environment. in many cases labs are mandatory. please make sure to check the course outline or speak to your instructor for details.\\nseminars: these are often used in graduate courses and are small in nature to encourage a great degree of class participation and class presentations.\\nstudio: some programs may have studio classes in which you execute a design or production related to your

our operating revenues are related to enrolment. approximately 56 per cent of our operating budget comes from tuition fees, 36 per cent from grants, and 8 per cent from other income-generating activities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what are toronto metropolitan university’s main

activities such as building maintenance, campus computing and technological services, research services, and administrative functions.\\nnearly three-quarters of our operating expenditures are for salaries and benefits. the majority of these costs are determined by negotiated collective agreements with our three main unions: the toronto metropolitan faculty association (tfa), the ontario public service employees union (opseu), and the canadian union of public employees (cupe).\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            will the university experience any funding reductions this year?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin november 2023, ontario’s blue-ribbon panel on postsecondary education financial sustainability recommended an increase of 5 per cent in tuition fees for 2024-25 (8 per cent for professional programs), with additional annual increases in future years. the panel also recommended an increase of 10 per cent in the government core operating grant along with annual increases in future years.\\xa0\\xa0\\nas of late january 2024, the government has not formally announced a decision about the recommendations of the blue-ribbon panel.\\xa0\\nin 2019-20, the government of ontario required universities to reduce domestic tuition fees by 10 per cent relative to 2018-19 levels. this brought fees back to approximately 2015-16 levels. fees have remained frozen at that reduced level. forgoing a tuition increase for even one year has a cumulative impact that will last for years to come. in every year following the freeze, any increases will be based on a lower tuition amount, meaning there will be a continued gap between inflation and incremental revenue. fees for international enrolment and cost-recovery programming, activity not supported with government grants, are not subject to this policy.\\nat the same time, there is uncertainty about how the recent federal decision to limit the number of international student study permits will be implemented, and what it will mean for international enrolment at tmu.\\ntoronto metropolitan university will continue ongoing conversations with our sector partners and take part in discussions with the ministry regarding guidelines and implementation details. in tandem, toronto metropolitan university will continue to develop contingency plans and options to address potential revenue loss.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            will planned capital projects be affected by changes in funding/anticipated budget cuts?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe university receives funding for capital projects from sources such as special, one-time government infrastructure allocations or from donations, and the funds are earmarked for specific building projects. funds for capital projects are one-time only and are not part of the university’s base budget, which funds ongoing expenditures. capital projects are therefore not affected by base budget reductions, and deferring capital projects will not result in base savings to the university. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how will the academic plan influence where money is spent across the university?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntoronto metropolitan university’s academic plan 2020-25 incorporates extensive feedback from students, faculty, and staff. budget planning and resource allocations are directly tied to the following five priorities, which will guide the direction of the university:\\n\\nthe student experience;\\nscholarly, research, and creative activity and graduate studies;\\nadvancing indigenous initiatives;\\ninnovation: continuing to challenge the status quo; and\\ncommunity and urban partnerships.\\n\\ntoronto metropolitan university has also undertaken broad internal and external consultations on a range of foundational strategies that will help guide and shape our institution. a developing blueprint, these five complementary plans (including the

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndonations tend to be directed to support designated student bursaries, short-term initiatives or specific projects, rather than being available for general operating purposes.\\nfor permanent staff positions and long-term commitments (e.g., maintenance of buildings, utilities), the university cannot rely on short-term donations or other one-time-only funds such as

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstrategic mandate agreements (smas) are established through negotiations with the ministry of colleges and universities that provide universities and colleges with an opportunity to communicate priorities, identify areas of institutional strength/focus, and set performance metrics. toronto metropolitan university and the ministry signed the 2020-2025 strategic mandate agreement\\xa0(external link)\\xa0 on august 31, 2020.\\na portion of the university’s funding is tied to performance on metrics as of 2023-24.\\xa0\\ntoronto metropolitan university successfully completed the ministry’s sma3 year 3 annual evaluation in 2023, and is currently participating in the ministry’s sma3 year 4 annual evaluation process (from november 27, 2023 to march 15, 2024) which continues data collection and analysis, assesses 2023-24 performance, and sets targets for 2024-25. tmu does not anticipate significant financial risks associated with sma metric performance in 2024-25.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            has toronto metropolitan university considered external partnerships (outside of government) to diversify our revenue streams?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyes, for example, there is a long-term strategic partnership between toronto metropolitan university and navitas. the cornerstone of this partnership, known as toronto metropolitan university international college (tmuic)\\xa0(external link)\\xa0, launched in winter 2021. it is a new, additional pathway program for international students designed to ease the transition to a canadian university environment and to prepare them for academic success. the partnership will accelerate tmu’s internationalization goals by growing and diversifying its international student population and enhancing toronto metropolitan university’s global reach.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            why is the university opening a new school of medicine at this time?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe expectation is that the ongoing activities related to this initiative will be supported by new, incremental revenue that is not related to our current enrolment. the government of ontario announced its support for the school of medicine, including funding for 94 undergraduate and 105 postgraduate seats that are resourced separately from tmu’s existing enrolment. the city of brampton donated an existing building along with funds to support renovations to establish the physical site for the school, and tmu is working with the federal and provincial governments and private donors to seek additional funding to support capital development.\\nontario is facing a shortage of primary care physicians who are unevenly distributed across communities, contributing to growing unmet care needs. for example, brampton is one of canada’s most culturally diverse and fastest-growing cities. in spite of this dynamism, its residents experience significant challenges with access to appropriate, high-quality primary care.\\xa0 tmu has the opportunity to engage with the brampton community and the surrounding region to develop a model for health care that can be adopted throughout ontario and beyond.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n

      how will toronto metropolitan university lobby for increased government funding and/or increased grants? do the funding metrics under the strategic mandate agreement make any additional funding available?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nalong with sector partners and the council of ontario universities (cou), we continue to make the case for sustainable, ongoing funding as recommended by the ontario blue-ribbon panel on postsecondary education financial sustainability. we have not yet attained an increase in the level of our operating grants. this continues to be a goal, and we will continue to demonstrate the need for an increased level of ongoing funding.\\xa0\\nthe funding metrics that are part of the government’s strategic mandate agreement process make an increasing portion of an institution’s existing government grants subject to meeting performance targets rather than allocating meaningful new funding.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how will the federal government’s cap on international student visas affect tmu? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe federal government sets a cap for each province, and individual provinces decide on the allocation among their institutions. at this time, the province has not announced how it will allocate spaces within ontario. tmu is advocating for an allocation that allows continued growth from the university’s relatively low current levels. our university has taken a measured approach to international enrolment, with roughly 10 per cent of our enrolment accounted for by international students compared to a system average of about 20 per cent. it should be noted that the cap does not apply to graduate programs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n    students, faculty & staff\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nopen all close all\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nas demonstrated in past years, toronto metropolitan university is focused on our core values throughout the budget-planning and consultation process – especially protecting and enhancing the student experience. the 2024-25 budget cycle will continue to prioritize the student community. in the past year, the university has made significant investments in student wellness, for example.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how is student aid funded?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstudent aid is funded through a combination of tuition fees and additional revenue streams, such as donations. in some cases, specific bursaries are funded through allocations made from department/faculty budgets.\\ntmu participates in the student access guarantee (sag) as required by the provincial government, covering direct costs for unmet need as assessed by osap through scholarships, bursaries or work-study employment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how does international tuition revenue get used? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ninternational tuition provides an important revenue stream for tmu. this revenue supports core teaching and learning functions at the university, and is also used for student support services, including international student support. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n    enrolment, recruitment and international\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nopen all close

university programs, we are on track to meet domestic enrolment targets for fall 2024. it is important to note that toronto metropolitan university is unable to increase domestic enrolment because the government has capped the number of funded spaces. \\nthe federal government’s recently announced cap on international student visas and delays with visa approvals present some challenges with international enrolment planning. our current level of international enrolment is low relative to other ontario universities, and increasing this is an important objective.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how does revenue from continuing education (ce) impact the budget? can we increase revenue and diversify enrolment? is ce enrolment unregulated?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe g. raymond chang school of continuing education offers a combination of degree-credit and certificate-credit courses. degree credit enrolment is counted as part of our enrolment that is funded by the government, which is capped at the overall university level. other chang school enrolments that are not degree-credit are not subject to limits and we will work to increase enrolment in these courses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what would happen to our budget if the enrolment growth stagnates (or declines)? how dependent are we on growth to maintain a balanced budget? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmore than 90 per cent of our operating revenues come from tuition fees and grants associated with enrolment. in other words, our financial health as an institution relies on enrolment. demand for toronto metropolitan university programs is strong. that said, domestic spaces are capped by the government, which precludes us from increasing the number of domestic students to generate additional revenue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nquick links\\n\\n\\n\\noffice of the provost and vice-president, academic \\nuniversity planning

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfirst year is a fun and exciting time, but will also involve a lot of work too! during the year you will meet tons of new people and have a lot of new academic experiences (lectures, labs and tutorials to name a few). this is a time for you to explore the different opportunities and resources that exist at the ted rogers school of management and toronto metropolitan university.\\nyour first year in the program will be a general year where you take several introductory courses that expose you to the different subject areas. this will prepare you for the rest of your studies and help you decide on what you would like to major in. the school of business management is made up of seven unique majors. your major is the subject area that you specialize in, meaning that there will be a certain amount of mandatory courses that you will need to take in that subject area to complete your major.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n    deregistration\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nopen all close all\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what is deregistration?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nderegistration is the removal of a student from classes by his or her school for a semester for failing to meet the requirements which the university makes a pre-condition of being allowed to register for courses. deregistered students can earn no credit towards their degree in that semester.\\nderegistration happens in the ted rogers school of business management when probationary students do not have their plan of study for a particular semester approved by the school. since they have failed to comply with the university\\'s requirement that probationary students \"may not continue their program studies until a specific plan for studies has been authorized by their program school or department and recorded with the registrar\", and since they have failed to have a probationary plan of studies (i.e. probationary contract) approved by their program department, the ted rogers school of business management has students\\' course enrolments and course intention requests cancelled for the term in question.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            can deregistered students take continuing education courses instead?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe restriction also applies to courses taken through continuing education or, indeed at any other institution, while a student is deregistered. however, courses can be taken for other, non-degree credit reasons, such as for interest, to practice improving study skills, or to complete a certificate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            are deregistration and being \\'required to withdraw\\' the same thing?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nno, they are very different, although in both cases the students are out of school for a determined period of time and receive no credit toward their degree for any courses taken during that time.\\nderegistration is not an academic standing like probation or being required to withdraw. it is the administrative action taken when students on probation fail to comply with the university\\'s requirement that they should have their courses approved (i.e. a probationary contract). deregistered students are still in the program on probation; they are simply not allowed to register for a semester. their transcript will show only that they took no courses that semester; it will not indicate why. deregistered students are not required to follow any program nor, since they are still in the program, to apply for reinstatement. space is guaranteed for them in the following semester, as it is for all students who are not on required to withdraw, and course selections for the next semester are retained and used to construct their timetables. they are entitled to continue in the following semester, assuming that they have their probationary plan of study approved and their contract signed.\\n\\'required to withdraw\\'\\xa0(opens in new window)\\xa0 is an academic standing indicating performance that is well below acceptable norms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            don\\'t you think it\\'s very unfair to stop someone from taking courses after they\\'ve paid their fees?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyes, it would be very unfair to do that since it is the ted rogers school of business management, acting in accordance with the university\\'s requirements, which deregisters the student. that\\'s why the fees for the semester are returned by the university. the fees department credits the deregistered student\\'s account as soon as the ted rogers school of business management sends the department notice of the deregistration. continuing education fees are also credited in the same way. the student may leave the money there to be used the following semester or may make a request in writing to the fees department that the fees be returned to them. a cheque is not sent out automatically, partly because students change their residences quite often without notifying records and partly because, since they are out of school for a semester, deregistered students may return home for the semester to work. the fees department wants to be sure that the refund goes to the right place and is not cashed by someone other than the student.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            don\\'t you think it\\'s a bit extreme to make a student lose a whole semester just for a technicality?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnot doing what you must do as a probationary student is not a technicality, it is a serious matter. the ted rogers school of business management has to set deadlines so that we know what probationary students are doing and whether they are following the requirements approved by business council for probationary students. the probationary students\\' contracts must be approved as soon as possible so that the students know where they stand and what they are responsible for from the beginning; that\\'s why we try to make that contracts are signed in early june for the fall semester and as early as possible in the winter semester.\\nthe ted rogers school of business management must ensure that the deadlines are enforced so that we know who has complied with the university\\'s requirements. we tried an honour system with the plans of study and the contracts before but very few students complied. many claimed that there were unaware that they had to do so or that they had to meet certain specific requirements. that\\'s why we now make sure that every probationary student is operating under the same rules, and meeting deadlines is part of that. in fact, most probationary students are very responsible about meeting their deadlines. it would be very unfair if those who do not feel they should be subject to the same requirements as others, or who don\\'t bother to find out what they must do on probation, were to be rewarded for their lack of responsibility.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what should a student do when they get a notice saying they are deregistered?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbefore the notice is sent, the ted rogers school of business management drops them out of all their courses. there is nothing else they must do except keep the letter somewhere safe, since it if the proof that we have done so.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what should a deregistered student do during the semester they are out of school?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwork on ensuring that whatever caused the problems that put them on probation in the first place will not affect them when they come back. if a student is not sure what to do to ensure this, or doesn\\'t think that they were responsible for going on probation, they should make an appointment with the academic advisor to discuss the situation. a full/part-time job will also provide new and useful perspectives which will help the student focus on studying, especially if it leads to a new career direction, when they return to school.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n    current students\\r\\n

graduates who have completed a university degree in addition to their college diploma are eligible for admission.\\nif you have completed a graduate degree, you are still required to submit proof of

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngenerally, we begin to make decisions starting in early spring. offers of admission begin mid-to-late-march and continue throughout the spring and often well into the summer. we will continue to evaluate applications until the program has filled all available spaces for the fall.\\n please feel free to check in with the program directly before you apply to confirm if we are still considering applications.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            can i get transfer credits?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwe are unable to evaluate transcripts for transfer credits before the student has been admitted to the program. please keep in mind that the mscm program is thesis based, not course based. you are required to pay a fixed tuition amount every term you are in the program and that tuition does not depend on how many courses you are enrolled in. as such, transferring one course is not going to have an impact on tuition. there is a chance that some of the elective courses required by our program could be replaced by a transferred course, but this would need an approval from your supervisor and the program director. to do this, the students must fill out the \"transfer credit application form\" from yeates school of graduate and postdoctoral studies, and submit all relevant documents (course outline, assignments, projects etc.). this process can only take place once you are already a toronto met student.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            is there a

attend courses at different times throughout the day. we strongly recommend that you do not attempt to work full-time while pursuing this degree.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            can you look at my transcript? am i eligible? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nno one at the program level has the required training to be able to evaluate transcripts. the transcripts are reviewed by admissions officers at the yeates school of graduate and postdoctoral studies before the applications are forwarded to the program for review. admissions officers will not perform pre-assessments of applications. if you think you meet the admissions requirements outlined here you are eligible to apply. you can learn more about how ysgps calculates gpa. meeting the minimum eligibility guarantees that your application will be reviewed by the program, but it does not guarantee admission. the applicant pools vary each year, so what might be a successful application one year, may not necessarily be successful the following year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            do you have gpa statistics on previously admitted students?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nour cohorts are small and the applicants are considered based on their entire application package, which includes their letter of intent with research potential, cv, reference letters, etc. finding a good supervisor as a match also strengthens the applications. as such, the gpa is not a good indicator of what makes a successful application.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncontact us\\nemail \\uf0e0\\nmscm@torontomu.ca\\naddress \\uf041\\xa0\\nsite location:\\n575 bay street (entrance at 55 dundas

what impact does dropping courses have on my osap assessment?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfull-time osap applicants\\n*note: there is no need to notify the student financial assistance (sfa) office if you drop a course(s). the sfa office automatically makes relevant adjustments to your osap application for you throughout each semester. please note there are possible implications to your osap when dropping courses, such as funding overpayments, possible reduction in future funding installments in the same academic year, and/or being placed on osap academic probation.\\nif you drop one or more courses but remain in a full-time course load, you will remain eligible for osap but may see a decrease in your funding assessment.\\nif you drop to a part-time course load or withdraw from all your courses, you will lose osap eligibility for the rest of the semester and you will likely see a decrease in your funding assessment.\\nnote: once six months lapse since you were last in a full-time course load and received osap, you will enter repayment. if you drop to a part-time course load but take a full-time course load again within six months and apply for either osap or continuation of interest-free status, repayment will not occur.\\ndropping courses always poses a risk of having osap overpayments, grant to loan conversion, and being placed on osap academic probation.\\npart-time osap applicants\\n*note: there is no need to notify the student financial assistance (sfa) office if you drop a course(s). the sfa office automatically makes relevant adjustments to your osap application for you throughout each semester.\\xa0\\nif you drop one or more courses during a term that you received part-time osap, you will be required to self-fund for the next semester during which you apply for part-time osap and\\xa0pass all the courses you take that semester.\\nexample: during the fall 2021 term, you receive part-time osap and then drop one course. you apply and receive full-time osap during the winter 2022 term. you then re-apply for part-time osap during the fall 2022 term - you will need to self-fund during the fall 2022 term.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how can i reset my osap password and/or retrieve my osap access number (oan)?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\noan password resets can be done in person or virtually:\\n\\nin-person: you can do an oan or password reset at any public college or university in ontario. you do not have to complete it at the institution you attended. if you opt to come in person at tmu, we offer oan or password reset on a walk-in basis through the servicehub.\\nvirtual: we offer limited virtual oan or password resets by appointment via google meet. you must have clear and available camera access to conduct a virtual appointment. to set up an appointment, please contact the servicehub

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfor osap purposes, your course load is determined based on the number of billings units associated with your enrolment.\\nat tmu, each course has an assigned billing unit (which allows us to determine your course load calculation for osap purposes). most courses at\\xa0tmu count as one billing unit.\\xa0\\nhowever, there are some courses that count as multiple billing units. the number of billing units is determined separately from the grade point average (gpa) weight/academic unit.  for osap purposes, each billing unit is equal to a 20% course load. for example, if you are taking one course that is weighted at three billing units, then you would have a 60% course load (three billing units x 20%).\\xa0\\ntherefore, in this scenario, you would be eligible to apply for\\xa0full-time osap. to see how many billing units a course is worth, please refer to your academic program section of the undergraduate calendar. the screenshot below shows an example of a course that counts as multiple billing units.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthis screenshot shows that one course (mwf 120) counts for five billing units.\\xa0\\nfor osap purposes, since the course is equivalent to five courses, you would be considered a full-time osap student at a 100% course load (five billing units x 20%).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            i added or dropped a course after my osap was confirmed. do i need to report this to the university?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwe encourage students to finalize their course load promptly before the start of term to avoid delays in their osap funding disbursements.\\nyou do not need to notify the university if your course load changed as a result of you adding or dropping courses unless a staff member has advised you to do so.\\xa0\\nthe sfa office audits students’ course loads regularly throughout each semester to identify course load changes and adjusts osap applications accordingly.\\xa0 if your adjusted course load results in any additional funding, it will automatically be released to the student. for information on the impacts of dropping a course, visit\\xa0“what impact does dropping courses have on my osap assessment?”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n

non-academic conduct is the university’s policy that outlines what is considered non-academic misconduct. non-academic offences includes behaviours that are threatening, intimidating or abusive; the theft, destruction or damage to property; or disruption to the learning and teaching environment. the academic code of conduct - what is commonly referred to as policy 60 - deals exclusively with academic integrity and conduct \\xa0that includes plagiarism, cheating, submission of false information.\\nstudents who live in a toronto met residence (such as pitman hall or the illc) are also expected to abide by the clear expectations of acceptable behaviour as a member of a residence community; these expectations are written in housing and residence life’s community standards.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            who can file a complaint under the code?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nany toronto met student,

ventures zone?\\nhow much time do i need to commit to participate in the social ventures zone?\\nwhere is the social ventures zone located?\\nwhat if i don’t have a good idea but want to get involved?\\n\\xa0\\nwhat is the social ventures zone?\\nthe social ventures zone was founded in 2014 by the toronto metropolitan university faculty of arts, building on the rich history of world-changing ideas and approaches from the humanities and social sciences. \\xa0it was designed as a place where teams of students, alumni, and innovators from the community could develop viable social enterprises that positively impact social issues.\\nthe overall aim of the social ventures zone is to develop and incubate the next generation of innovative and sustainable solutions to canada’s most pressing social challenges. \\xa0as they develop their social enterprises, team’s progress along a continuum of learning that will give them the entrepreneurial skills and work experience necessary for whatever their future might hold.\\nwhat support does the social ventures zone provide?\\nmore than a co-working space, the social ventures zone is a community of innovators from a variety of backgrounds and disciplines who are supported by coaching, training sessions, incubation space, peer-to-peer connections and other community resources. \\xa0alex gill, our social innovator in residence, provides overall direction and support to venture teams, backed by a team of community coaches and the peer support and encouragement from the other teams. \\xa0innovators can also engage a growing roster of subject matter experts drawn from toronto metropolitan's faculty, giving them on-demand access to the most up-to-date knowledge and research about their social issues.\\nwho can apply to the social ventures zone?\\nfrom big to small and local to global, we’re looking for creative ideas and ventures that have the promise of sustainability and impact. toronto metropolitan university undergraduate and graduate students (or alumni) from any faculty – or innovators from the broader community – can apply with their idea.\\nhow are projects selected for the social ventures zone?\\nindividuals or venture teams can apply with their social enterprise by completing an online application form. \\xa0our admissions committee is made up of faculty, staff, fellow entrepreneurs, and community members and meets each semester (three times per year) to evaluate ventures requesting admission. \\xa0each application is blindly scored according to the following criteria:\\npotential impact: \\xa0\\xa0how will the venture impact people or the environment, address a serious concern and/or have a potential to engage community partners?\\ndegree of innovation: \\xa0to what degree does the venture idea mimic established approaches or does it present a new and innovative approach (and the potential for disruptive change)?\\npotential of sustainability: \\xa0has the individual or team thought through how the venture can be viable (e.g. multiple sources of revenue, support of a partner, etc)?\\npersonal capacity: \\xa0does the team lead and/or team members have a demonstrated history of self-starting, a passion for the issue, etc.?\\nafter the admissions committee reviews and evaluates the online application, it may choose one of two (2) options:\\n\\ndecide not to accept the application and recommend other courses of action to improve the idea for resubmission, suggest other places it can find support, etc.; or, \\noffer stage one approval and ask the individual and/or team proponent(s) to attend an in-person pitch session with committee members \\n\\nproponents who are asked to pitch in person should prepare a basic slide deck (no more than ten slides) explaining their project and why it is a good fit for the social ventures zone. \\xa0each pitch should be no more than ten minutes long and will then be followed by up to 15 minutes of questions from the committee. \\xa0for an example of a template presentation, check out guy kawasaki’s pitch guidelines\\xa0(external link)\\xa0.\\xa0\\nin the event that the venture is not accepted, the committee will provide the proponents with feedback as to why and make suggestions, as appropriate, for further work on the concept, other places they may go for support, etc.\\nwhat makes an application to the social ventures zone successful?\\nthe social ventures zone receives dozens of applications for each round of admissions and our admissions committee selects the ones that best fit the criteria for admission. but in addition to the criteria outlined above, we often receive applications that are rejected because they fall into the following categories:\\n\\nventures that are not true social ventures, but rather businesses that have some social aspect. \\xa0for example, if your idea is to build a new dating app but donate a portion of proceeds to charity, that does not meet our definition of a social venture because it does not have a social issue at the core of its operations. \\ninnovators who do not sufficiently support their idea. \\xa0we sometimes receive pitches from innovators who propose what looks like an innovative idea but they do not support it with research, an organizational model or a basic understanding of the population it will help, etc. \\nideas that are better suited to a community group or student club. \\xa0while social progress often comes from the dialogue and connections that happen in groups of volunteers, such groups are not per se a social venture. \\n\\nhow do i apply?\\ninnovators can join the social ventures zone as one of three cohorts we accept each year. to determine whether applications are currently open or when they might be, check here.\\nshould you have questions or need assistance completing the application, you are welcome to call 416-979-5000 ext. 7255 or email socialventures@torontomu.ca.\\nhow much does it cost to join the social ventures zone?\\nthere is no cost involved to apply to the social ventures zone and successful ventures are not charged a fee once accepted. \\xa0ventures accepted into the zone are provided with free access to resources, professional advice, funding opportunities, skill development, and ongoing mentorship from successful community innovators and social entrepreneurs.\\nhow much time do i need to commit to participate in the social ventures zone?\\nventure team members are expected to contribute a minimum of 10-12 hours per month to their social enterprise. \\xa0this includes your participation in workshops and modules, time dedicated to your venture, and ongoing peer-to-peer collaboration.\\non that note, we believe in helping, not holding back. while focus is a good thing, we know that innovators sometimes need encouragement. \\xa0they need to know others believe in them and can pitch in to help, when needed. \\xa0that is why we want the social ventures zone to be a space where we actively look for opportunities to help our fellow innovators when we see them facing a challenge. \\xa0because what we give, we get back.\\nwhere is the social ventures zone located?\\nwe are located at 40 gould street, kerr hall south 45 (khs 045). you can find the entrance under the arches across from balzac’s on gould street.\\nwhat if i don’t have a good idea but want to get involved?\\nthe social ventures zone offers a supportive environment for ideas that are at least partially formed, have a team and are ready to put more work into moving their venture forward. \\xa0but we welcome people whose idea is still in the early stages or who would like to learn more about social enterprise, entrepreneurship and community change. \\xa0we offer the following opportunities to:\\n\\ndevelop ideas and formulate a plan through degree credit courses such as ssh400.\\xa0 \\n\\n\\njoin an ideation cohort at the zone and develop your initial idea into a pitch-worthy one! \\xa0each term, we accept a small number of innovators who want to improve their ideas through a regular series of ideation sessions. \\xa0for more information, contact socialventures@torontomu.ca \\n\\n\\nget inspired at special events, speakers’ series, and workshops hosted across campus. check out\\xa0zone learning\\xa0and the office of social

periodically and facilitate opportunities for student input. in order to maintain our commitment to excellence and fairness of process, and to comply with the legislative requirements, toronto

available on tmu’s administrative policies webpage.\\nthe university reviewed the svp to ensure it continues to reflect an institutional commitment to foster a campus free from sexual violence and promote a culture of consent within our community in a trauma-informed way. the svp review involves a consultation process with the tmu community. students, faculty, contract lecturers and staff will be invited to contribute feedback about the svp through online surveys and town halls. there will also be feedback sessions with administrators of the svp and subject-matter experts, faculty, contract lecturer and staff unions, undergraduate and graduate student unions and other stakeholders.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what is a policy review?\\r\\n

brampton. why brampton?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntmu selected brampton as the location for the school of medicine because the community is diverse, resilient, innovative and a microcosm of what communities will look like across canada in the future.\\xa0\\nwe are building this medical school with the communities it will serve. brampton residents, community agencies and health partners have all provided unwavering support in project approvals, planning, and development so we will be ready to welcome our first cohort of medical students and residents in 2025.\\xa0\\nbrampton’s population has increased rapidly and the region’s growth has been shaped by immigration. it is also a region of the province that has been chronically underfunded and has been hit by a higher rate of occurrence of covid-19.\\nin addition, brampton and toronto metropolitan university have existing partnerships through several initiatives, including the cybersecure catalyst, and brampton ventures zone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            where in brampton will the school of medicine be located? why was this location chosen?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe bramalea civic centre in brampton-peel has been selected as the future site of tmu's school of medicine.\\nthe bramalea civic centre was chosen for its proximity to both the brampton civic and peel memorial hospitals as well as its accessibility to municipal transportation, go transit and highway systems the site is also close to a variety of services and amenities to support the needs and well-being of our students, faculty and staff; it provides ready access to green space and active transportation infrastructure, such as walking and biking trails. \\nthe site also meets the space requirements to build a school of medicine that will require 250,000 square feet for classrooms, offices, research facilities and an integrated health clinic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            why is toronto metropolitan university interested in a medical school?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntoronto metropolitan university believes it can offer a new approach to medical education in ontario — one that draws on the university’s commitment to community, diversity and inclusion, and innovation to address the changing needs for health care delivery and practice.\\nbuilding on the strength and foundation of deep and broad community and industry partnerships, tmu is ideally situated to shape the future of health care. the university’s new approach to medical education will meet the current pain points in the healthcare system, which have been exacerbated by the global pandemic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            does toronto metropolitan university have the expertise and academic programming experience needed to open a medical school?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntoronto metropolitan university is known for its focus on excellence in health across various faculties and departments. for example, the academic programs in areas such as psychology, nursing, social work, occupational health and safety, midwifery, biomedical engineering, physics (medical physics) and biology and chemistry are all major contributors to the university’s regional and national presence in the health field based on their magnitude of research and their undergraduate and graduate enrolments. a new school of medicine will build on this foundation of excellence and leadership in health education.\\ntmu is distinctly solutions-oriented, demonstrated through its teaching, research and community partnerships. the university is deeply engaged with unity health and with st michael's hospital, where its labs in the hospital’s research wing support on-site collaboration between clinical needs and bio-engineering know-how. the institute of biomedical engineering, science and technology\\xa0(external link)\\xa0 (ibest), the biomedical zone (bmz), and the medtech talent accelerator,\\xa0(external link)\\xa0 are examples of successful innovative collaborations. tmu is also home to the national institute of ageing and the healthcare user experience lab.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            is toronto metropolitan university partnering with any hospital in brampton?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwilliam osler health system\\xa0(external link, opens in new window)\\xa0 is tmu’s primary hospital partner in providing the clinical learning environment for undergraduate medical education, other health professionals’ education, residency training and professional development.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how will the school of medicine address equity, diversity and inclusion (edi)?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nequity, diversity and inclusion (edi) and reconciliation will be intentionally infused throughout all facets of the tmu school of medicine, including: \\n\\nadmissions;\\xa0\\nfaculty and staff recruitment;\\xa0\\neducational programming;\\xa0\\nthe learning environment;\\xa0\\ncurriculum;\\xa0\\nscholarly, research and creative (src) activities;\\xa0\\nenterprise; and\\xa0\\npatient, family, and community engagement.\\xa0\\n\\nwe will continually foster a culture of inclusion and engagement and advance social justice. the tmu school of medicine will be the first medical school in canada founded and intentionally built upon the foundations of social accountability, edi and reconciliation.\\xa0\\nto facilitate the integration of edi into all aspects of the planning and program development process, a school of medicine edi advisory committee was established to create an edi strategy and action plan. the resulting plan has also been endorsed by the academic program development committee\\xa0 \\nthis work is also guided by the school of medicine’s equity, diversity and inclusion values statement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how will the school of medicine address truth and reconciliation?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na vital component of the truth and reconciliation process is public recognition of the tragic and painful history and the ongoing impacts of residential schools.\\nour university has been on its own path of truth and reconciliation with the work of the \\xa0(pdf file)\\xa0standing strong task force. as a starting point, we draw inspiration from the \\xa0(pdf file)\\xa0truth and reconciliation commission’s final report\\xa0(external link)\\xa0 and in particular calls to action 18 through 24, which specifically address the need for action for indigenous health. of these, calls to action 22 through 24 are the most relevant to medical school contexts. in particular, they address the need for indigenous understandings of health and well-being, a holistic admissions process and the creation of pathway programs for indigenous learners.\\nin addition, the association of faculties of medicine of canada’s indigenous working group has provided a crucial roadmap for the implementation of the truth and reconciliation commission calls to action in their \\xa0(pdf file)\\xa0joint commitment to action on indigenous health\\xa0(external link)\\xa0. their report highlights the importance of accountability and of thoughtful, reciprocal relationships with indigenous communities to advance reconciliation and indigenous health.\\nboth documents serve as an important reminder of the need to form respectful, reciprocal, long-term relationships with indigenous-led organizations early in the planning process to set the foundation for a meaningful commitment to action. the university is committed to developing meaningful relationships with indigenous communities through a co-creation approach to define the terms of the relationship and ensuring accountability mechanisms are in place. we recognize that co-creation is a long-term process of relationship- and trust-building.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            when will the school of medicine open?\\r\\n

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nafter broad community engagement and extensive research, the university’s standing strong (mash koh wee kah pooh win) task force recommended that the university be renamed to better align with institutional values.\\xa0\\nthe recommendation and subsequent decision to rename was not based on a vilification of egerton ryerson but instead was based on the understanding that a new name is necessary to create a more inclusive campus culture and environment. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how did the university go about the renaming process?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfollowing the board of governors' august 2021 decision to accept the standing strong task force recommendations, president lachemi announced our commitment to determining a new name by the end of the 2021/22 academic year. to reach this goal, the university renaming advisory committee (urac) was established.\\xa0\\nin april 2022, the urac concluded their community and expert informed process and submitted a shortlist of possible names for president lachemi’s consideration. after careful deliberation, one of the names was recommended to the board of governors for approval.\\xa0\\nfor more information on the renaming process, please visit the university renaming\\xa0webpage.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how long will it take for the new name to be fully integrated?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhile the new name - toronto metropolitan university - was adopted and registered immediately upon approval by the board of governors on april 26, 2022, the overall transition to the new name is happening in phases.\\xa0\\xa0\\nsome university materials changed immediately, such as webpages and social media handles, while other changes, such as external signage on campus buildings and amendments to legal documents, including degrees, will take longer.\\nthe ontario legislature voted to amend the\\xa0ryerson university act\\xa0on december 1, 2022, allowing the new name to be reflected on legal documents issued by the university.\\non december 8, 2022 the amendment received royal assent from the lieutenant governor, legally changing our university’s name to toronto metropolitan university.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n

need to get rid of ryerson branded items that still have value or are of use to you, the branded materials transition project provides the opportunity for community members to drop off their unwanted

and team name would be determined. on august 29, 2022 the new team, tmu bold, along with plans for the development of a falcon mascot were announced. new athletic uniforms and the new mascot will be

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyour hard-earned degree remains an accomplishment to celebrate, and a credential worthy of promotion. alumni are certainly encouraged to keep and display their old degrees with pride, if they are comfortable doing so.\\xa0\\nthe university understands that not all alumni may want to keep their degree issued under our former name. alumni who wish to have their degree reissued under our new name can do so. this is a service the university has always offered and alumni will continue to have this option now that we have been renamed toronto metropolitan university.\\xa0\\nmore details on this will be posted to the curriculum advising webpage when available.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how should i refer to my

with the option to use either ryerson university or the new university name when listing their education. for current alumni, ryerson will be the default under their school information, but linkedin members will be able to switch manually to the new name a few days following the announcement. further instructions will follow on the steps required to make this manual

licensed to give supervision, care and advice to clients during pregnancy, labour and the postpartum period, to conduct deliveries on their own and to care for the newborn child.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            2. how do midwives in ontario work?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmidwives usually work in community\\xadbased group practices. they attend births in hospitals, at client's homes, and in birth centres. they provide care throughout pregnancy, labour, birth and up to six weeks postpartum to the client and their baby.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            3. do i need to be a nurse before i can become a midwife?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nno. midwifery is an autonomous profession separate and distinct from nursing and medicine. while there are basic skills that are common to all three professions, midwifery has a unique scope of practice and model of care.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            4. what type of educational background do students who are accepted to the program typically have?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmidwifery students come from a wide variety of educational backgrounds. many of them have received previous university undergraduate degrees while others have graduate degrees, college diplomas, or are mature students. prospective students are strongly recommended to have completed a minimum of one year of university education.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            5. what are my chances of acceptance into the program with little or no experience in the health field?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npast experience may be taken into account during the selection process, but it is by no means a necessary requirement for acceptance into the program. applicants are assessed for those qualities that will enable the individual to become a good midwife.\\xa0 places in the program have been offered to applicants from many different walks of life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            6. what is the earning potential for a midwife in ontario?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nplease consult the association of ontario midwives for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            7. what is the employment outlook for students on completing the program?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwith demand for midwives exceeding supply, there are many opportunities for graduates to fill positions in ontario and other provinces in canada. once students complete the program, they must write the canadian midwifery registration exam (cmre) and then they are eligible to apply to the college of midwives of ontario for registration and are required to work in an established midwifery practice for one year. toronto metropolitan university graduates have successfully found positions in midwifery practices across ontario and other parts of canada.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            8. what's the philosophy of the program?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe educational program is based on the following beliefs and values:  we believe that midwifery has the potential to be one of the most important components of women’s health care in ontario. midwives’ expertise in the care of normal pregnancy and childbirth arises from their understanding of childbearing as a social, cultural and biological process and from their ability to competently exercise clinical skills and decision\\xad-making. midwifery education must provide the base for sound professional practice.  we believe that midwives are the best persons to teach the professional practice of midwifery. in addition we believe that the educational program has a special responsibility to foster partnerships between midwives and other health care providers for the benefit of students and women who seek midwifery care.  we believe the educational program is an integral part of the evolution of the profession of midwifery in ontario and canada. the program must help create future leaders and teachers. it must establish practice and teaching as a continuum so that learning environments become available across ontario.  we believe the educational program will best assure the acquisition of knowledge, skills and values, and foster critical thinking if the academic setting is respectful of students, is committed to scholarly enquiry and emphasized the lifelong ability to learn and change.  we believe that accessible education, which is both flexible and culturally sensitive, requires high quality distance education.  we believe that the collaborative model of program development and management described herein provides both a reflection of and a model for professional practice in the field of midwifery.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            9. where can i find the supplementary application form used in midwifery?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin addition to meeting the competitive academic requirements for the program, mep applicants are required to submit the midwifery self-id and admissions survey. the survey is used to gather information on applicants' clinical placement region preferences and their desire to participate in the voluntary equity admissions self-id and/or indigenous admissions processes. the survey is due by february 1st and is access through an applicant's choosetmu applicant portal\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n    quick links\\r\\n

created by third-parties (non-google and non-tmu) and have the ability to interact with your google apps for edu account (your tmu gmail, calendar and google drive, and other google apps for edu services). \\nindividuals cannot turn on the ability to install these services. they must either be enabled for everyone by tmu or for no one. working with the privacy and security officers, ccs has been investigating whether these services should be enabled at tmu. \\neach add-on requires the person who used it to agree to permissions such as granting the third party the ability to view and manage your email or send email on your behalf.\\n the third parties also have separate terms of service from tmu’s contract with google. this means that these applications are not covered by our agreement with google, which raises privacy, security, legal and records management concerns. \\xa0\\nit also means that the privacy and security requirements we have established for the core google apps for edu services may not be met by these third-party applications. \\nfor example, while testing, we discovered that some of these applications do not support tmu’s expectation of “privacy as a default setting,” one of the seven principles of\\xa0privacy by design\\xa0(external link)\\xa0. \\nas a result of all of these risk factors, we have decided not to enable the ability to install add-ons in google apps for edu at tmu.\\nplease note that by design from google, tmu users will always see the “add-ons” menu while in a google doc or spreadsheet and while users can browse these add-ons, they will not be able to install and use them since tmu’s google apps administrators in ccs have not enabled this service for tmu.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n    import

(cas) as our single sign on (sso) solution. it’s used to access my.torontomu portal, google apps for tmu and many other web applications. \\xa0for security reasons and to help mitigate phishing attacks, it is important that users are able to view the url of the cas login page in the browser address bar. hence, we do not allow cas login page to be embedded in other web pages, for example, via an inline frame (iframe). and we have mechanism in place to break out of embedded pages such as iframes. \\xa0in such cases, you will get \\xa0\"authentication required\" cas page.\\nsites often embed google technologies in them, such as google calendar, google forms \\xa0and google maps etc. \\xa0some of these want to retrieve your google data (your avatar, gmail address etc), so google tries to authenticate you. \\xa0depends on your google authentication session, if it has timed out, you will be redirected to google login page. \\xa0if you’ve used google apps for tmu, you will be redirected to cas login page. \\xa0as these all happened in the embedded iframe, cas breaks out of the frame and present you with the \"authentication required\" page.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            i have gone to my.torontomu.ca and logged in. when i click the \"manage my resources...\" i do not have the

permanently in late 2020, classic hangouts will remain available through the web by going to hangouts.google.com\\xa0(external link)\\xa0. within gmail, the new google chat will appear in place of the classic hangouts. there is no option to revert back to classic hangouts in gmail. direct messages sent in classic hangouts or google chat can be viewed and replied to in the other service. group

will allow you to add additional participants. spaces are great for teams to collaborate, share up-to-date information and meet on the fly. for help in choosing whether you want to start a space or a

users directly in gmail, you can now use google meet to make phone calls instead. in terms of voice calls and text messaging (sms), this feature is now offered via google voice (google voice is not available at tmu). for faculty and staff, you can make phone calls using the cisco jabber client\\xa0(opens in new window)\\xa0, this will allow you to make and receive phone calls on your tmu

as grades on tests and papers. you should not provide a third party with any personal information. you also do not need to provide such things as exam questions, teaching materials or research notes, as these are excluded. if you have a question you may contact tmu’s privacy officer at\\xa0fippa@torontomu.ca. if you choose not to honour a request for information, the requestor has a right to file

requested and to determine if any exclusions or exemptions apply. fees are charged to the requestor for the time taken to search for and, if appropriate, prepare records for release.\\xa0 if the

apply to records that are personal to you (including business activities unrelated to the university). however, if you don’t keep those records separate from your university records, it is possible that confusion could occur as to what is actually the university’s and what is yours. a best practice is to keep these separate and clearly mark those files that do not belong to the university (e.g. separate file cabinet, separate folders on computer and email).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q10: what types of student and general records do i need to retain and

disposed of when no longer needed: \\n\\nduplicate stocks of publications, printed literature or blank forms, including those associated with computer-based information systems;\\nduplicate records within the same media retained solely for convenient reference or future distribution (examples include branch-wide memos; \"all staff\" e-mails; notices of holidays, special events or routine administrative matters; and personal desk copies of such items as program studies or committee minutes);\\nbroadly distributed materials (such as manuals, directives, bulletins and guidelines) used to communicate policies and practices for internal administration (other than original copies kept by the office from which the materials were issued);\\nphone messages, personal messages, and records documenting activities such as holiday parties or charitable fund drives unconnected to program functions; \\nunsolicited advertising materials;\\npublications such as books, journals, magazines, newspapers, newsletters, and published reports which form or will form part of a library\\'s catalogued holdings or are stored within branch libraries or reference shelves;\\npublication extracts which have no significant value in documenting how program data was collected or decisions reached, and which have not therefore been integrated within program files;\\ntemporary working papers such as rough notes or informal drafts that are of no value in documenting data collection or in showing how tmu policies or programs were developed or implemented. (that is, they represent no significant steps in the preparation of a final document, were not reviewed by other persons, do not record program decisions, and do not contain important research or background data.)\\nmanagers should ensure that all transitory items are deleted or destroyed immediately when no longer needed.\\n\\n official tmu records \\nofficial records are distinct from transitory records. official records serve important business functions, such as supporting program delivery or policy development, or meeting legal, financial and other needs. they may also provide important evidence of institutional decisions and actions. these should only be destroyed in accordance with with tmu’s record retention schedule (see\\xa0records management policy).\\nrecords containing personal information \\nanything which has personal information must be retained for a minimum of one year under fippa. personal information includes, but is not limited to: name, home address, home phone number, student’s email address (home or tmu), identifying numbers (e.g. student number, employee number or social insurance number), education history (grades, degrees received, academic misconduct) health history, or opinions about an individual.\\xa0 your professional contact information is generally not perceived as personal information (faculty’s business phone number, tmu email, business mailing address). see the definition of “personal information” in the freedom of information and protection of privacy act available on the general counsel’s information access and privacy website. \\xa0\\naccording to tmu\\'s\\xa0course management policy 166, all student work is to be returned to the student before the end of the academic term.\\xa0 final exams and unclaimed assignments are the only type of student work that, under fippa, will need to be retained for the one-year period because these are not returned to students.\\xa0\\xa0\\nyou should also retain all documents and correspondence that may be part of the academic or academic conduct appeals process. you are required by the course management policy to submit a copy of your grade sheet to the department/school.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q11: what should be my e-mail protocol and retention in regard to correspondence with students?\\r\\n

during a course or for advising regarding their educational path should be retained for one year under fippa.\\xa0 particular emphasis is placed upon retaining correspondence that reveals something personal about the student beyond their email address (student id, educational or medical history, financial information, questions about course work, evaluations, etc.).\\xa0 this also includes any correspondence that may pertain to an appeal.\\xa0 you should only correspond with students on their “ryerson.ca” email accounts as per tmu’s policy for the\\xa0establishment of student email accounts for official university communication 157.\\nyou should be careful about the content of e-mails as they may be retained not only by you but by others, and they can be requested as part of an foi request. generally, the “reply all” response should be avoided unless it is necessary. you can never be assured of what is retained by others; so, even if you have deleted an email, that’s no guarantee it will not end up being released as a result of an foi request.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q12: can i send multiple students one email using their tmu

use their email address, such as for personal communications, or for communications outside tmu.\\xa0\\nfaculty and staff, however, should take care in using student email addresses.\\xa0 be cautious in sending group emails; disclosing personal information such as grades, internship placements, home contact information, or details about an academic appeal to other students as these situations would all constitute a privacy breach and tmu\\'s privacy officer must be notified immediately.\\xa0\\nif you want to send a group email and the text does not identify individuals, consider using the blind-copying function. refrain from disclosing the student’s email address to non-tmu personnel unless you have the consent of the student.\\xa0\\xa0\\nusing d2l brightspace to post general information messages to students is one low-risk option.\\xa0 for messages aimed at a specific group of students within a course try using the blind-copying function on your email system; this way students can only see their own address and cannot see who else received the message.\\xa0 it is important to note that the content of the message should dictate the method used to communicate information to students; the more sensitive the information, the less appropriate group communication, including email will be.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q13:

serve on appeals panels or who are charged with academic advising may confidentially access these records for that purpose only. chairs/directors and their specified administrative staff may access

information to impersonate another student.\\xa0 the more information disclosed, the better able some one would be in committing fraud.\\xa0 a similar approach to that outlined in the course management policy section 2.2(f) should be followed where only part of the student number is included. it is recommended that the last 4 digits be used.\\xa0 in other words, professors can request that students working on group assignments hand in projects listing a portion of the student id number and no names.\\xa0 in this way the other students in the group will not be privy to the entire

to put into practice as a result of what they have learned in the program. they are a series of measurable statements which, taken together, describe what graduates can do with the learned body of knowledge, the set of skills, and the attitudes or values considered important for success in the discipline. program learning outcomes also clarify the program’s purpose and objectives for students and instructors in order to improve communication, shared expectations, and program coherence.\\neffective program learning outcomes can be observed and/or assessed. rather than describing what the instructor will do or cover in a course, program learning outcomes describe what knowledge, skills, and values graduates will be able to demonstrate through presentation, discussion, action, or in

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfor departments and schools, learning outcomes provide a roadmap for curriculum, and a goal post for student achievement. they serve as essential reference points for academic departments to discuss the elements that contribute to an integrated program of study. the ontario quality framework requires programs to be intentional about the choice and development of their program outcomes and to clearly communicate their roadmap for student learning.\\nfor instructors, program learning outcomes provide a broad picture of the program and offer insights into how each course and other program experiences contribute to the development of the knowledge, skills, and values/attitudes expected of their graduates.\\xa0\\nfor students, program learning outcomes communicate the skills successful graduates will develop, and the types of knowledge they learn in preparation for employment, further education, and to participate as critically informed citizens.\\xa0\\nfor employers, program learning outcomes outline what they can confidently expect from potential employees.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what is the difference between program goals/objectives and program learning outcomes? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe difference between program objectives or goals and program outcomes is a difference in perspective. program goals or objectives are part of the planning process. they describe what a program plans or seeks to achieve. the focus is on what is promoted in and delivered by the program (e.g. broad areas of focus or approach(es), learning activities used, and experiences or opportunities offered). program objectives also help define what makes the program unique and meaningful, and ultimately provide direction and justification for program and course-level curricular decisions.\\nin contrast, program learning outcomes focus on the skills developed by graduates, outlining the knowledge, skills, and values/attitudes that a graduate will be able to demonstrate. rather than focus on the material that will be covered or the experiences they’ll have, program learning outcomes focus on how students understand and employ that material and the specific knowledge, skills and attitudes they will be able to demonstrate as a result.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncomparison of udles, program objectives, program learning outcomes, and course learning outcomes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n swipe to see more

    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nprogram objectives and program learning outcomes are used at toronto metropolitan to guide the design and revision of all academic programs.\\nnew program development\\xa0\\nall new program development involves developing program objectives, and identifying the skills, knowledge and capabilities of the intended graduate,\\xa0 which are then refined into intended program learning outcomes. both the program objectives and the intended program learning outcomes should be developed before planning courses, or laying out the structure for a program. the courses, structures, and course elements should then be designed to provide students with the experiences required to achieve the program’s intended outcomes and to align with the program’s objectives. otherwise, it can be likened to designing a car by providing superb and highly specialized components first, and leaving it to students to make sense of how they may or may not fit together.\\nperiodic program review (ppr)\\nthe ppr process begins with a thorough review of the program objectives and program learning outcomes. program objectives are developed or updated to ensure that there are clear and relevant goals guiding what is promoted in and delivered by the program. program learning outcomes are reviewed and updated to ensure that they are demonstrable and represent the relevant, current, and discipline-specific knowledge, skills, and related attributes expected of program graduates. mapping courses to the program learning outcomes helps identify where and how outcomes are achieved, and supports the review of how the learning is delivered and assessed in the program.\\nmajor curriculum modification(s)\\nany major curriculum modification involves mapping the changes to both the ontario degree-level expectations (dles) and the program learning outcomes to ensure that sufficient coverage is achieved or maintained. mapping the modified curriculum helps to ensure that all changes support students’ achievement of the program learning outcomes, and that there are no resulting gaps or inconsistencies.\\xa0\\nstrong and intentional curricular design at each of these stages ensures learning is thoughtfully integrated and assessed throughout the program so that students can acquire the knowledge, skills, and values/attitudes needed to progress from one year to the next, and to succeed upon graduation.\\nbackwards design: once you have determined the knowledge, skills, values and attributes that graduates of your program should have, the next step is to articulate those skills in demonstrable and measurable program learning outcomes. the curriculum is then designed and developed to meet those outcomes.\\xa0\\n\\nwiggins & mctighe’s understanding

responsible for delivering the program, and be informed by disciplinary experts, potential employers, and/or others as appropriate to the field. your curriculum specialist will provide support and guidance when developing objectives and learning outcomes for new programs. please contact us for additional information or support.\\nperiodic program review\\xa0\\nrevising program goals and program learning outcomes for program review should include the core ppr team consisting of faculty members and an administrative assistant. the process will at times involve all faculty members who regularly teach the core components of the program. academic program delivery requires a collective commitment and shared responsibility. your curriculum specialist will provide support and guidance to the

of all undergraduate and graduate degrees granted by ontario universities. dles indicate the knowledge and skill outcomes, reflecting levels of intellectual and creative development, at specified degree levels (i.e. bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral). dles also help to ensure program learning outcomes are appropriate, degree-graduates meet the expected competencies of the credential, and the quality and value of the credential is comparable across institutions. all ontario universities have agreed to use ocav’s guidelines as a threshold framework for their own degree-level expectations.\\ndles for undergraduate and graduate programs\\xa0(external link)\\xa0\\xa0are delineated into six broad categories:\\n\\ndepth and breadth of knowledge\\nknowledge of methodologies

map offers a comprehensive picture of the program’s curriculum to facilitate a thorough overview and analysis of the program as a whole.\\nwe use the curriculum insights (ci) application for program mapping. in addition to generating a comprehensive curriculum map, ci also generates reports that map teaching and assessment methods, for incorporation into the ppr self-study.\\nanalysing the curriculum map with program instructors helps clarify and unify program expectations, facilitates collaborative planning, and helps the program plan future changes and enhancements to maintain the integrity and coherence of the program. analysing the program map in light of other ppr data points (e.g. student, alumni, and employer feedback; industry trends, advancements in the field; program advisory council feedback, etc.) also helps to identify and prioritize opportunities for program enhancement.\\ncontact your curriculum specialist for these resources and guidance with curriculum

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe ppr is intended to engage programs in reflection, analysis, and evaluation of the current state of the program curriculum, with the goal of continuous improvement. the program-wide lens supports curricular analysis and helps to identify:\\n\\nprogram strengths\\xa0\\nareas for enhancement\\nprogram-specific evidence and metrics\\n\\nthis information informs and supports future curriculum modifications, thereby improving the quality of the learning experience for students. the prr self study is, therefore, both an analysis of a program’s current state and development since the last review, as well as a planning tool in a forward-facing document meant to guide future development.\\nmore broadly, the objective of ppr is to examine the quality of degree programs to ensure that they achieve and maintain the highest possible standards of academic excellence and continue to satisfy societal need.\\xa0 although the ppr process and requirements are guided by ryerson’s iqap, the creation of the ppr self-study is program-led and involves the contributions of faculty, staff, students, and program stakeholders.\\xa0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n

review should take approximately 18-20 months to complete.\\nstage 1, the preparation of a self-study document by the program, takes approximately 12 months. to facilitate timely completion, the office of the vice provost academic provides resources and support to programs throughout the ppr process.\\nstage 2, which involves reviews, approvals, and a visit from a peer-review team, takes roughly an additional 8 months.\\nthe undergraduate ppr manual includes a \\xa0(google doc)\\xa0recommended timeline\\xa0(external link, opens in new window)\\xa0\\xa0to help programs plan and schedule accordingly for their review. this timeline is mapped to an october start-date, but can be used as a roadmap to schedule ppr sequencing whenever the program chooses to begin its ppr.\\ncontact your curriculum specialist for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what if the program is also scheduled to complete a professional accreditation review? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npprs may be coordinated with any professional accreditation review, if feasible, and accreditation review information can be used to supplement the ppr. however, a self-study and appendices, separate from an accreditation review report, are required since pprs and accreditation reviews have different requirements, purposes, and goals.\\nthe vice-provost academic may require a separate peer review team (prt) when the accrediting body’s assessment does not fully cover all areas required by the university’s ppr process. the ppr prt report must also be a separate document from the accreditation prt report.\\nthe curriculum quality team is available to work with accredited programs to identify areas of overlap and help make the ppr and accreditation complimentary processes. professionally accredited undergraduate programs should consult the vice-provost academic for further guidance and assistance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            who participates in course mapping?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe ppr process should engage all teaching members of the program in the course mapping. once the learning outcomes have been established by the core ppr team of the school/department, all relevant courses to the degree should be mapped accordingly. many programs at tmu rely on cupe 1 contract lecturers for the delivery of compulsory courses. as the ppr process offers programs the opportunity to reflect on current practices, it is therefore important to include course perspectives as taught by cupe 1 contract lecturers.\\nplease note that cupe 1 contract lecturers participating in the course mapping process are to be remunerated as follows: a minimum of 2 hours at $100.00/hour. please note that cupe 1 contract lecturers, either with a teaching contract during this process, or not, are to be invited into the process and paid according to the above guidelines. the mapping work is considered out-of-scope as per articles 17.2 and 17.3 of the unit 1 collective agreement.\\nthe payment can be processed via a

analysis, and writing the self-study. however, a successful and effective program review depends on active involvement and support from a range of contributors, including the program director/chair or director of the school/department, curriculum committee, faculty/instructors, students, and the faculty dean.\\nthe office of the vice-provost academic advises programs throughout the review process

other postsecondary institution in canada, toronto metropolitan university’s mix of academic programs embraces the broad spectrum of creative industries. from publishing and journalism to tv production, fashion, interior design, dance and film, the university’s diverse media, design and artistic programs will contribute their courses and faculty expertise to the delivery of the creative industries curriculum. the utilization of these academic resources in combination with the business courses provided by the ted rogers school of management has resulted in a creative curricular design that, unique among canadian undergraduate programs, studies the creative disciplines from the perspective of enterprise development and entrepreneurship and blends artistic, media and communication, cultural and business studies to prepare students for employment opportunities in today’s creative economy.\\nthe first such program of its kind in canada or north america, the creative industries b.a. program has many novel features, including:\\n\\nthe combination of a b.a. degree with a business specialization.\\ncreative-content modules: students will complete two 5-course sequences selected from a long list of creative fields: music, publishing, news media, film, performance studies, broadcasting, communication, fashion, curatorial practices, and more\\na work placement in a creative company that is integrated into a 4th year “capstone” project\\n\"imagining the creative city\" – a unique first-year course that explores how cities embrace and stimulate creativity\\n\"the creative process\" - an innovative third-year course exploring how creative ideas happen and how creativity can be fostered in teams and enterprises\\nupper level courses focusing on collaboration, teamwork, negotiation and managing creative enterprises\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what can i do with a creative industries degree?\\r\\n

degree incorporating a business specialization will prepare you for a broad range of career opportunities depending on the focus you have chosen for your studies.\\nthe operation of creative enterprises has grown increasingly complex in the 21st century due primarily to the impact of information, communication and mobile technologies. such dramatic change requires new skills, new business models and new global perspectives. in view of these challenges, employers in the private sector, governments, cultural organizations and other non-government organizations are seeking graduates with multi-disciplinary competencies in diverse areas including global marketing and free-trade agreements, government policies and regulation, team management, human resources and intellectual property issues. the educational structure of the creative industries program – in which financial and operational aspects on the one hand and creative processes on the other are studied simultaneously and viewed as an inseparable combination -- will prepare you for a highly cross-disciplinary and collaborative work environment that demands a mix of creative, technological and business talents.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            will i be able to pursue graduate studies after graduating?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyes.

and/or\\ncourse at capacity – there were more intentions for the course\\xa0 than seats in the class. not all students with intentions\\xa0 could be enrolled; and/or\\nmissing prerequisite(s) – you

backup course\\nlook to see if there is an alternative course that will fulfill the same degree requirement being offered that term. it is always best to get into a backup course and then switch out if a space opens up in the course that you want, rather than run the risk of being left with no course at all.\\xa0\\nwaitlists\\nnot all courses offer a waitlist option, but a lot do. if there is a waitlist, get yourself on to it, and as people drop the course, you will move up the list.\\nmake sure you understand how waitlists work, as every year people try to put themselves onto a waitlist for a course that they are already in.\\n\\uf0a1\\xa0note: waitlists are not for swapping sections - they are there to help students get into a course they are not yet in.\\xa0\\nlearn more about

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyou may encounter an error message during the course intention selection process. some possible reasons could include:\\n\\nthe course you are trying to add requires “departmental permission”. for courses requiring ‘departmental permission’, you will need to contact the department offering the course during the course intention period to have that course manually added to your intentions. you cannot add the course yourself.\\nrestricted courses: some courses are restricted (i.e. off limits) for some programs during the course intention period. for example, an rta course may be restricted to rta students for the course intentions period. the university will make sure all programs that require the course have first enrolment. only once those students are all in, will any remaining spots become available for general enrolment. this typically happens during the ‘open enrolment period’.\\nthe course you are trying to add is not part of your curriculum and is non-applicable to your degree requirements.\\ntaking courses out of sequence. for example, myservicehub may block enrollment if you try to add a lower level liberal studies (table a) course, which is normally taken during the first two years in the program, to your course intentions selections for third year.\\ncourse prerequisite(s) not met.\\nyou may have a hold on your account that blocks enrollment. an\\xa0account hold\\xa0is a restriction placed on your myservicehub account related to outstanding fees owed or other unresolved obligations with the university. to resolve this hold you will need to review your holds in your student center on myservicehub and contact the appropriate department for further advice (as indicated in the hold

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nquestion \\nanswer \\n\\n\\nwhat do i need to know as a graduating student? \\nhead over to our graduate checklist to make sure you check off all that needs to get done for a smooth convocation experience. \\xa0 \\n\\n\\nhow do i get tickets? what do i need to know about tickets? \\nto obtain tickets, you must request them when you register for your convocation ceremony.\\xa0 each grad will receive guest tickets each with a unique barcode (number of guest tickets will be 3 or 4 depending on how many graduates are in a ceremony). each ticket may be sent directly to guests (via email) or downloaded and distributed to each of your guests manually. each ticket may only be scanned once – please ensure that each of your guests has a unique ticket in hand (on a mobile device or a printed copy) for the ceremony. guests who do not have a unique ticket will not be permitted entry into the convocation arena. extra tickets for seating are not available for any convocation ceremony. \\n\\n\\ndo children need tickets to attend the ceremony?\\nanyone older than five years will need their own ticket. younger children can attend without a ticket but must sit in a guest's lap. please keep in mind the ceremonies are typically two hours long. we encourage guests with young children to sit near exits in case you need to step outside. \\xa0 \\n\\n\\nis there a fee to attend convocation?\\nthere is a $55 ceremony fee. this fee includes: the use of regalia, guest tickets, and the post-ceremony celebration for you and your guests. \\n\\n\\nwhen do i arrive for my ceremony? \\narrive on time for your ceremony (8:00 a.m. for 9:30 a.m. ceremony; 2:00 p.m. for 3:30 p.m. ceremony) and sign in using your confirmation or onecard. the procession starts 30 minutes before the ceremony, so it is very important for you to arrive on time. \\n\\n\\nwhat do i do with personal items on the day of my ceremony? \\npersonal items may be left in the line up area (this area is unsupervised) or you may bring them with you into the convocation arena.\\xa0 if you are arriving with your guests you may also leave items with them. hold on to your phone for photos of your big day! \\n\\n\\nwhat should i tell my guests? \\nlet guests know that doors open 1h30min before the ceremony. they may arrive then or anytime before the graduand procession (9:00 a.m. or 3:00 p.m, depending on your ceremony time). there is no assigned seating. guests may also refer to the information for guests page to learn more. note, no helium balloons are allowed inside of the mattamy athletic centre. should you or your guests bring any, you will be asked to dispose of them at the entrance. \\n\\n\\nwhat do i wear to my ceremony? \\nwe suggest business or business casual attire to wear under your academic regalia. for more information about what you can wear, read our regalia guidelines. we also suggest that you wear comfortable shoes! you will be standing, walking and climbing flights of stairs for more than an hour before your ceremony commences. only phd grads wear mortarboards/hats as part of their regalia. \\n\\n\\nwhat happens during the ceremony? \\nyou will be guided through your convocation ceremony by marshals. they will seat you, line you up before crossing the stage, and answer your questions along the way.\\xa0 the most important things to remember are: don’t lose your namecard and have fun! convocation ceremonies are typically two hours. \\n\\n\\nwhat happens after the ceremony?\\xa0 \\npost-ceremony celebrations are held on the fourth floor. enjoy and celebrate! you will need to retain your rsvp confirmation or your onecard to checkout of the ceremony. \\n\\n\\nwhere do i return my regalia? \\nreturn your regalia to grad gown return no later than one hour after your ceremony. if you do not return your gown and hood you will be invoiced $150. you will not be able to obtain transcripts until payment is made or the regalia is returned in good condition. \\n\\n\\ni have an accommodation request for myself or my guest. what should i do? \\nyou will have an opportunity to make an accommodation request when you register for your convocation ceremony. accessible seating for guests is provided on the third floor of the mac.\\xa0 all ceremonies have live asl interpreters and live-captioning on screen in the convocation arena. for more information contact the ceremonials office at convocation@torontomu.ca. \\n\\n\\ni'm not planning, or cannot attend my convocation. what do i do? \\nif you are not attending convocation, you may graduate in absentia. if extenuating circumstances arise that affect your ability to attend your convocation ceremony, a case-file may be started to evaluate your attendance eligibility. please visit the\\xa0curriculum advising\\xa0page to learn more. when graduating in absentia, after july 1 or november 1 (for spring or fall convocation), you may arrange a courier of your document by logging into your servicehub account and submitting an online graduation document courier request. alternatively, your award document will be made available for pick-up at the servicehub, pod150. if you are unable to pick up your document yourself you may authorize someone else to pick it up on your behalf. you must provide this individual with a letter of authorization, which must include: your signature, your full name, your student number, your program name, term of graduation, and the full name of the person you are authorizing to pick up your document. the individual picking up your document must also provide photo identification proving they are the person stated in the authorization letter. \\n\\n\\nhow do i take graduation photos?\\ngrad photos and class composites are a service provided by the tmu students' union\\xa0(external link)\\xa0. please contact them directly for more information.\\n\\n\\nwhere/when can i get my photo taken after i crossed the convocation stage? where can i get my

your experience. for the last 73 years, the faculty and staff at the university have worked hard to provide an exceptional educational experience for students. the university's programs and graduates

our operating revenues are related to enrolment. approximately 56 per cent of our operating budget comes from tuition fees, 36 per cent from grants, and 8 per cent from other income-generating activities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what are toronto metropolitan university’s main

activities such as building maintenance, campus computing and technological services, research services, and administrative functions.\\nnearly three-quarters of our operating expenditures are for salaries and benefits. the majority of these costs are determined by negotiated collective agreements with our three main unions: the toronto metropolitan faculty association (tfa), the ontario public service employees union (opseu), and the canadian union of public employees (cupe).\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            will the university experience any funding reductions this year?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin november 2023, ontario’s blue-ribbon panel on postsecondary education financial sustainability recommended an increase of 5 per cent in tuition fees for 2024-25 (8 per cent for professional programs), with additional annual increases in future years. the panel also recommended an increase of 10 per cent in the government core operating grant along with annual increases in future years.\\xa0\\xa0\\nas of late january 2024, the government has not formally announced a decision about the recommendations of the blue-ribbon panel.\\xa0\\nin 2019-20, the government of ontario required universities to reduce domestic tuition fees by 10 per cent relative to 2018-19 levels. this brought fees back to approximately 2015-16 levels. fees have remained frozen at that reduced level. forgoing a tuition increase for even one year has a cumulative impact that will last for years to come. in every year following the freeze, any increases will be based on a lower tuition amount, meaning there will be a continued gap between inflation and incremental revenue. fees for international enrolment and cost-recovery programming, activity not supported with government grants, are not subject to this policy.\\nat the same time, there is uncertainty about how the recent federal decision to limit the number of international student study permits will be implemented, and what it will mean for international enrolment at tmu.\\ntoronto metropolitan university will continue ongoing conversations with our sector partners and take part in discussions with the ministry regarding guidelines and implementation details. in tandem, toronto metropolitan university will continue to develop contingency plans and options to address potential revenue loss.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            will planned capital projects be affected by changes in funding/anticipated budget cuts?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe university receives funding for capital projects from sources such as special, one-time government infrastructure allocations or from donations, and the funds are earmarked for specific building projects. funds for capital projects are one-time only and are not part of the university’s base budget, which funds ongoing expenditures. capital projects are therefore not affected by base budget reductions, and deferring capital projects will not result in base savings to the university. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how will the academic plan influence where money is spent across the university?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntoronto metropolitan university’s academic plan 2020-25 incorporates extensive feedback from students, faculty, and staff. budget planning and resource allocations are directly tied to the following five priorities, which will guide the direction of the university:\\n\\nthe student experience;\\nscholarly, research, and creative activity and graduate studies;\\nadvancing indigenous initiatives;\\ninnovation: continuing to challenge the status quo; and\\ncommunity and urban partnerships.\\n\\ntoronto metropolitan university has also undertaken broad internal and external consultations on a range of foundational strategies that will help guide and shape our institution. a developing blueprint, these five complementary plans (including the academic plan) articulate our academic and strategic directions:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0(pdf file)\\xa0\\nthe campus master plan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0(pdf

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndonations tend to be directed to support designated student bursaries, short-term initiatives or specific projects, rather than being available for general operating purposes.\\nfor permanent staff positions and long-term commitments (e.g., maintenance of buildings, utilities), the university cannot rely on short-term donations or other one-time-only funds such as short-term grants or contracts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how will the strategic mandate agreement (sma) affect our funding?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstrategic mandate agreements (smas) are established through negotiations with the ministry of colleges and universities that provide universities and colleges with an opportunity to communicate priorities, identify areas of institutional strength/focus, and set performance metrics. toronto metropolitan university and the ministry signed the 2020-2025 strategic mandate agreement\\xa0(external link)\\xa0 on august 31, 2020.\\na portion of the university’s funding is tied to performance on metrics as of 2023-24.\\xa0\\ntoronto metropolitan university successfully completed the ministry’s sma3 year 3 annual evaluation in 2023, and is currently participating in the ministry’s sma3 year 4 annual evaluation process (from november 27, 2023 to march 15, 2024) which continues data collection and analysis, assesses 2023-24 performance, and sets targets for 2024-25. tmu does not anticipate significant financial risks associated with sma metric performance in 2024-25.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            has toronto metropolitan university considered external partnerships (outside of government) to diversify our revenue streams?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyes, for example, there is a long-term strategic partnership between toronto metropolitan university and navitas. the cornerstone of this partnership, known as toronto metropolitan university international college (tmuic)\\xa0(external link)\\xa0, launched in winter 2021. it is a new, additional pathway program for international students designed to ease the transition to a canadian university environment and to prepare them for academic success. the partnership will accelerate tmu’s internationalization goals by growing and diversifying its international student population and enhancing toronto metropolitan university’s global reach.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            why is the university opening a new school of medicine at this time?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe expectation is that the ongoing activities related to this initiative will be supported by new, incremental revenue that is not related to our current enrolment. the government of ontario announced its support for the school of medicine, including funding for 94 undergraduate and 105 postgraduate seats that are resourced separately from tmu’s existing enrolment. the city of brampton donated an existing building along with funds to support renovations to establish the physical site for the school, and tmu is working with the federal and provincial governments and private donors to seek additional funding to support capital development.\\nontario is facing a shortage of primary care physicians who are unevenly distributed across communities, contributing to growing unmet care needs. for example, brampton is one of canada’s most culturally diverse and fastest-growing cities. in spite of this dynamism, its residents experience significant challenges with access to appropriate, high-quality primary care.\\xa0 tmu has the opportunity to engage with the brampton community and the surrounding region to develop a model for health care that can be adopted throughout ontario and beyond.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n

      how will toronto metropolitan university lobby for increased government funding and/or increased grants? do the funding metrics under the strategic mandate agreement make any additional funding available?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nalong with sector partners and the council of ontario universities (cou), we continue to make the case for sustainable, ongoing funding as recommended by the ontario blue-ribbon panel on postsecondary education financial sustainability. we have not yet attained an increase in the level of our operating grants. this continues to be a goal, and we will continue to demonstrate the need for an increased level of ongoing funding.\\xa0\\nthe funding metrics that are part of the government’s strategic mandate agreement process make an increasing portion of an institution’s existing government grants subject to meeting performance targets rather than allocating meaningful new funding.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how will the federal government’s cap on international student visas affect tmu? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe federal government sets a cap for each province, and individual provinces decide on the allocation among their institutions. at this time, the province has not announced how it will allocate spaces within ontario. tmu is advocating for an allocation that allows continued growth from the university’s relatively low current levels. our university has taken a measured approach to international enrolment, with roughly 10 per cent of our enrolment accounted for by international students compared to a system average of about 20 per cent. it should be noted that the cap does not apply to graduate programs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n    students, faculty & staff\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nopen all close all\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nas demonstrated in past years, toronto metropolitan university is focused on our core values throughout the budget-planning and consultation process – especially protecting and enhancing the student experience. the 2024-25 budget cycle will continue to prioritize the student community. in the past year, the university has made significant investments in student wellness, for example.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how is student aid funded?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstudent aid is funded through a combination of tuition fees and additional revenue streams, such as donations. in some cases, specific bursaries are funded through allocations made from department/faculty budgets.\\ntmu participates in the student access guarantee (sag) as required by the provincial government, covering direct costs for unmet need as assessed by osap through scholarships, bursaries or work-study employment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how does international tuition revenue get used? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ninternational

university programs, we are on track to meet domestic enrolment targets for fall 2024. it is important to note that toronto metropolitan university is unable to increase domestic enrolment because the government has capped the number of funded spaces. \\nthe federal government’s recently announced cap on international student visas and delays with visa approvals present some challenges with international enrolment planning. our current level of international enrolment is low relative to other ontario universities, and increasing this is an important objective.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how does revenue from continuing education (ce) impact the budget? can we increase revenue and diversify enrolment? is ce enrolment unregulated?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe g. raymond chang school of continuing education offers a combination of degree-credit and certificate-credit courses. degree credit enrolment is counted as part of our enrolment that is funded by the government, which is capped at the overall university level. other chang school enrolments that are not degree-credit are not subject to limits and we will work to increase enrolment in these courses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what would happen to our budget if the enrolment

come from tuition fees and grants associated with enrolment. in other words, our financial health as an institution relies on enrolment. demand for toronto metropolitan university programs is strong. that said, domestic spaces are capped by the government, which precludes us from increasing the number of domestic students to generate additional revenue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nquick links\\n\\n\\n\\noffice of the provost and vice-president, academic \\nuniversity planning

tools has raised a number of questions for instructors and students alike. recognizing that the pace at which these technologies are developing, as well as the infancy of established best practices for ai in postsecondary education, below are the university’s current recommendations in the form of questions and answers.\\ninstructors who'd like to learn more about ai in higher ed are encouraged to review the centre for excellence in learning & teaching's new teaching resources page, join our community of practice\\xa0(external link)\\xa0\\xa0(cop) and/or to explore the faculty-led video presentations that have taken place during our cop lunch and learns.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nopen all close all\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            should students use ai?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nunless explicitly stated by the instructor, students should assume that using ai to complete assessments is prohibited. if students use ai to complete assessments, instructors may consider it 1) misrepresentation of personal identity or performance and/or 2) plagiarism and/or 3) cheating.\\nif your instructor gives you permission to use ai, the expectation is that you cite the output just as you would cite any other source.\\xa0\\napa\\xa0(external link)\\xa0, mla\\xa0(external link)\\xa0, chicago style\\xa0(external link)\\xa0\\nwhile ai is something that should be avoided when creating anything that will be evaluated by your professor, ai can be a great learning companion, assuming you understand that ai output needs to be critically evaluated. cornell university\\xa0(external link)\\xa0 devised these key questions that you can use to interrogate the integrity of the ai output:\\n\\nis the ai-generated content accurate? how can you test or assess the accuracy?\\ncan other credible sources (outside of generative ai) validate the data or item produced?\\xa0\\nhow does the information generated impact or influence your thinking on this topic?\\nwho is represented in this data? is the data inclusive in terms of the material’s scope and the perspectives that it presents?\\xa0\\n\\nas well, we have some \\xa0(google

use of ai for assessments?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncurrently, policy 60\\xa0(opens in new window)\\xa0 does not explicitly address ai usage. however, if a student were to submit text, images, designs or any other academic work generated by ai without proper attribution, instructors could consider that plagiarism. further, instructors could consider ai use to be cheating as described in policy 60, appendix a, section 3.1:\\n“having ready access to and/or using aids or devices (including wireless communication devices) not expressly allowed by the instructor during an examination, test, quiz, or other evaluation.”\\n* please note that policy 60 is currently under review and we anticipate that specific language on artificial intelligence will be added.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            can instructors prohibit and/or authorize student use of ai on assessment?\\r\\n

of business management be like? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfirst year is a fun and exciting time, but will also involve a lot of work too! during the year you will meet tons of new people and have a lot of new academic experiences (lectures, labs and tutorials to name a few). this is a time for you to explore the different opportunities and resources that exist at the ted rogers school of management and toronto metropolitan university.\\nyour first year in the program will be a general year where you take several introductory courses that expose you to the different subject areas. this will prepare you for the rest of your studies and help you decide on what you would like to major in. the school of business management is made up of seven unique majors. your major is the subject area that you specialize in, meaning that there will be a certain amount of mandatory courses that you will need to take in that subject area to complete your major.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n    deregistration\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nopen all close all\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what is deregistration?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nderegistration is the removal of a student from classes by his or her school for a semester for failing to meet the requirements which the university makes a pre-condition of being allowed to register for courses. deregistered students can earn no credit towards their degree in that semester.\\nderegistration happens in the ted rogers school of business management when probationary students do not have their plan of study for a particular semester approved by the school. since they have failed to comply with the university\\'s requirement that probationary students \"may not continue their program studies until a specific plan for studies has been authorized by their program school or department and recorded with the registrar\", and since they have failed to have a probationary plan of studies (i.e. probationary contract) approved by their program department, the ted rogers school of business management has students\\' course enrolments and course intention requests cancelled for the term in question.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            can deregistered students take continuing education courses instead?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe restriction also applies to courses taken through continuing education or, indeed at any other institution, while a student is deregistered. however, courses can be taken for other, non-degree credit reasons, such as for interest, to practice improving study skills, or to complete a certificate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            are deregistration and being \\'required to withdraw\\' the same thing?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nno, they are very different, although in both cases the students are out of school for a determined period of time and receive no credit toward their degree for any courses taken during that time.\\nderegistration is not an academic standing like probation or being required to withdraw. it is the administrative action taken when students on probation fail to comply with the university\\'s requirement that they should have their courses approved (i.e. a probationary contract). deregistered students are still in the program on probation; they are simply not allowed to register for a semester. their transcript will show only that they took no courses that semester; it will not indicate why. deregistered students are not required to follow any program nor, since they are still in the program, to apply for reinstatement. space is guaranteed for them in the following semester, as it is for all students who are not on required to withdraw, and course selections for the next semester are retained and used to construct their timetables. they are entitled to continue in the following semester, assuming that they have their probationary plan of study approved and their contract signed.\\n\\'required to withdraw\\' (opens in new window)  is an academic standing indicating performance that is well below acceptable norms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            don\\'t you think it\\'s very unfair to stop someone from taking courses after they\\'ve paid their fees?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyes, it would be very unfair to do that since it is the ted rogers school of business management, acting in accordance with the university\\'s requirements, which deregisters the student. that\\'s why the fees for the semester are returned by the university. the fees department credits the deregistered student\\'s account as soon as the ted rogers school of business management sends the department notice of the deregistration. continuing education fees are also credited in the same way. the student may leave the money there to be used the following semester or may make a request in writing to the fees department that the fees be returned to them. a cheque is not sent out automatically, partly because students change their residences quite often without notifying records and partly because, since they are out of school for a semester, deregistered students may return home for the semester to work. the fees department wants to be sure that the refund goes to the right place and is not cashed by someone other than the student.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            don\\'t you think it\\'s a bit extreme to make a student lose a whole semester just for a technicality?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnot doing what you must do as a probationary student is not a technicality, it is a serious matter. the ted rogers school of business management has to set deadlines so that we know what probationary students are doing and whether they are following the requirements approved by business council for probationary students. the probationary students\\' contracts must be approved as soon as possible so that the students know where they stand and what they are responsible for from the beginning; that\\'s why we try to make that contracts are signed in early june for the fall semester and as early as possible in the winter semester.\\nthe ted rogers school of business management must ensure that the deadlines are enforced so that we know who has complied with the university\\'s requirements. we tried an honour system with the plans of study and the contracts before but very few students complied. many claimed that there were unaware that they had to do so or that they had to meet certain specific requirements. that\\'s why we now make sure that every probationary student is operating under the same rules, and meeting deadlines is part of that. in fact, most probationary students are very responsible about meeting their deadlines. it would be very unfair if those who do not feel they should be subject to the same requirements as others, or who don\\'t bother to find out what they must do on probation, were to be rewarded for their lack of responsibility.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what should a student do when they get a notice saying they are deregistered?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbefore the notice is sent, the ted rogers school of business management drops them out of all their courses. there is nothing else they must do except keep the letter somewhere safe, since it if the proof that we have done so.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what should a deregistered student do during the semester they are out of school?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwork on ensuring that whatever caused the problems that put them on probation in the first place will not affect them when they come back. if a student is not sure what to do to ensure this, or doesn\\'t think that they were responsible for going on probation, they should make an appointment with the academic advisor to discuss the situation. a full/part-time job will also provide new and useful perspectives which will help the student focus on studying, especially if it leads to a new career direction, when they return to school.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n    current students\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nopen all close all\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n

graduates who have completed a university degree in addition to their college diploma are eligible for admission.\\nif you have completed a graduate degree, you are still required to submit proof of completion of a 4-year undergraduate degree with a minimum grade of b (73%) in the last two years of studies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            will there be an

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngenerally, we begin to make decisions starting in early spring. offers of admission begin mid-to-late-march and continue throughout the spring and often well into the summer. we will continue to evaluate applications until the program has filled all available spaces for the fall.\\n please feel free to check in with the program directly before you apply to confirm if we are still considering applications.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            can i get transfer credits?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwe are unable to evaluate transcripts for transfer credits before the student has been admitted to the program. please keep in mind that the mscm program is thesis based, not course based. you are required to pay a fixed tuition amount every term you are in the program and that tuition does not depend on how many courses you are enrolled in. as such, transferring one course is not going to have an impact on tuition. there is a chance that some of the elective courses required by our program could be replaced by a transferred course, but this would need an approval from your supervisor and the program director. to do this, the students must fill out the \"transfer credit application form\" from yeates school of graduate and postdoctoral studies, and submit all relevant documents (course outline, assignments, projects etc.). this process can only take place once you are already a toronto met student.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            is there a

           can you look at my transcript? am i eligible? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nno one at the program level has the required training to be able to evaluate transcripts. the transcripts are reviewed by admissions officers at the yeates school of graduate and postdoctoral studies before the applications are forwarded to the program for review. admissions officers will not perform pre-assessments of applications. if you think you meet the admissions requirements outlined here you are eligible to apply. you can learn more about how ysgps calculates gpa. meeting the minimum eligibility guarantees that your application will be reviewed by the program, but it does not guarantee admission. the applicant pools vary each year, so what might be a successful application one year, may not necessarily be successful the following year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            do you have gpa statistics on previously admitted students?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nour cohorts are small and the applicants are considered based on their entire application package, which includes their letter of intent with research potential, cv, reference letters, etc. finding a good supervisor as a match also strengthens the applications. as such, the gpa is not a good indicator of what makes a successful application.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncontact us\\nemail \\nmscm@torontomu.ca\\naddress  \\nsite location:\\n575 bay street (entrance at 55 dundas street west)

                       \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfor students in the ted rogers co-op program, additional fees are added to their tuition fees. these fees relate to costs associated with the administration of the co-op programs and are calculated in accordance with the ministry of advanced education and skills development and toronto metropolitan university policies.\\nco-op fees, in part, cover the costs associated with the administration of the co-op program which includes pre-employment training, the administration of work-term activity (obtaining job postings, preparation of students for the work terms, monitoring work term activity, debriefing students and employers during the employment process), and the recruitment of co-op employers.\\nthe total co-op fee for 2022-2023 is $3,500.00*. fees are paid in installments spread over a number of sessions (fall, winter) to reduce the burden on you.  co-op fees are participation fees and are not based on the number of work terms secured, nor when work terms are secured. students who secure at least 3 co-op work terms (12 months total) are required to pay the full co-op fees according to their respective fee payment schedule.  *co-op fees and payments are non-refundable and subject to change without notice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how does co-op change my

alternating between academic terms and work terms. this will extend your undergraduate studies to 4.5-5 years, with 16 months of paid work experience.\\nall co-op students are required to follow the

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfull-time osap applicants\\n*note: there is no need to notify the student financial assistance (sfa) office if you drop a course(s). the sfa office automatically makes relevant adjustments to your osap application for you throughout each semester. please note there are possible implications to your osap when dropping courses, such as funding overpayments, possible reduction in future funding installments in the same academic year, and/or being placed on osap academic probation.\\nif you drop one or more courses but remain in a full-time course load, you will remain eligible for osap but may see a decrease in your funding assessment.\\nif you drop to a part-time course load or withdraw from all your courses, you will lose osap eligibility for the rest of the semester and you will likely see a decrease in your funding assessment.\\nnote: once six months lapse since you were last in a full-time course load and received osap, you will enter repayment. if you drop to a part-time course load but take a full-time course load again within six months and apply for either osap or continuation of interest-free status, repayment will not occur.\\ndropping courses always poses a risk of having osap overpayments, grant to loan conversion, and being placed on osap academic probation.\\npart-time osap applicants\\n*note: there is no need to notify the student financial assistance (sfa) office if you drop a course(s). the sfa office automatically makes relevant adjustments to your osap application for you throughout each semester. \\nif you drop one or more courses during a term that you received part-time osap, you will be required to self-fund for the next semester during which you apply for part-time osap and pass all the courses you take that semester.\\nexample: during the fall 2021 term, you receive part-time osap and then drop one course. you apply and receive full-time osap during the winter 2022 term. you then re-apply for part-time osap during the fall 2022 term - you will need to self-fund during the fall 2022 term.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how can i reset my osap password and/or

reset at any public college or university in ontario. you do not have to complete it at the institution you attended. if you opt to come in person at tmu, we offer oan or password reset on a walk-in basis through the servicehub.\\nvirtual: we offer limited virtual oan or password resets by appointment via google meet. you must have clear and available camera access to conduct a virtual appointment. to set up an appointment, please contact the servicehub directly. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            is my course load calculated by billing units or by enrolled courses?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfor osap purposes, your course load is determined based on the number of billings units associated with your enrolment.\\nat tmu, each course has an assigned billing unit (which allows us to determine your course load calculation for osap purposes). most courses at tmu count as one billing unit. \\nhowever, there are some courses that count as multiple billing units. the number of billing units is determined separately from the grade point average (gpa) weight/academic unit.  for osap purposes, each billing unit is equal to a 20% course load. for example, if you are taking one course that is weighted at three billing units, then you would have a 60% course load (three billing units x 20%). \\ntherefore, in this scenario, you would be eligible to apply for full-time osap. to see how many billing units a course is worth, please refer to your academic program section of the undergraduate calendar. the screenshot below shows an example of a course that counts as multiple billing units.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthis screenshot shows that one course (mwf 120) counts for five billing units. \\nfor osap purposes, since the course is equivalent to five courses, you would be considered a full-time osap student at a 100% course load (five billing units x 20%).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            i added or dropped a course after my osap was confirmed. do i need to report this to the university?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwe encourage students to finalize their course load promptly before the start of term to avoid delays in their osap funding disbursements.\\nyou do not need to notify the university if your course load changed as a result of you adding or dropping courses unless a staff member has advised you to do so. \\nthe sfa office audits students\\' course loads regularly throughout each semester to identify course load changes and adjusts osap applications accordingly.  if your adjusted course load results in any additional funding, it will automatically be released to the student. for information on the impacts of dropping a course, visit \"what impact does dropping courses have on my osap assessment?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntoronto metropolitan

non-academic conduct is the university's policy that outlines what is considered non-academic misconduct. non-academic offences includes behaviours that are threatening, intimidating or abusive; the theft, destruction or damage to property; or disruption to the learning and teaching environment. the academic code of conduct - what is commonly referred to as policy 60 - deals exclusively with academic integrity and conduct  that includes plagiarism, cheating, submission of false information.\\nstudents who live in a toronto met residence (such as pitman hall or the illc) are also expected to abide by the clear expectations of acceptable behaviour as a member of a residence community; these expectations are written in housing and residence life's community standards.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            who can file a complaint under the code?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nany toronto met student,

community member's ability to learn, study, work or teach. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                             i received a letter from the student conduct officer. what should i

ventures zone?\\nhow much time do i need to commit to participate in the social ventures zone?\\nwhere is the social ventures zone located?\\nwhat if i don't have a good idea but want to get involved?\\n \\nwhat is the social ventures zone?\\nthe social ventures zone was founded in 2014 by the toronto metropolitan university faculty of arts, building on the rich history of world-changing ideas and approaches from the humanities and social sciences.  it was designed as a place where teams of students, alumni, and innovators from the community could develop viable social enterprises that positively impact social issues.\\nthe overall aim of the social ventures zone is to develop and incubate the next generation of innovative and sustainable solutions to canada's most pressing social challenges.  as they develop their social enterprises, team's progress along a continuum of learning that will give them the entrepreneurial skills and work experience necessary for whatever their future might hold.\\nwhat support does the social ventures zone provide?\\nmore than a co-working space, the social ventures zone is a community of innovators from a variety of backgrounds and disciplines who are supported by coaching, training sessions, incubation space, peer-to-peer connections and other community resources.  alex gill, our social innovator in residence, provides overall direction and support to venture teams, backed by a team of community coaches and the peer support and encouragement from the other teams.  innovators can also engage a growing roster of subject matter experts drawn from toronto metropolitan's faculty, giving them on-demand access to the most up-to-date knowledge and research about their social issues.\\nwho can apply to the social ventures zone?\\nfrom big to small and local to global, we're looking for creative ideas and ventures that have the promise of sustainability and impact. toronto metropolitan university undergraduate and graduate students (or alumni) from any faculty - or innovators from the broader community - can apply with their idea.\\nhow are projects selected for the social ventures zone?\\nindividuals or venture teams can apply with their social enterprise by completing an online application form.  our admissions committee is made up of faculty, staff, fellow entrepreneurs, and community members and meets each semester (three times per year) to evaluate ventures requesting admission.  each application is blindly scored according to the following criteria:\\npotential impact:   how will the venture impact people or the environment, address a serious concern and/or have a potential to engage community partners?\\ndegree of innovation:  to what degree does the venture idea mimic established approaches or does it present a new and innovative approach (and the potential for disruptive change)?\\npotential of sustainability:  has the individual or team thought through how the venture can be viable (e.g. multiple sources of revenue, support of a partner, etc)?\\npersonal capacity:  does the team lead and/or team members have a demonstrated history of self-starting, a passion for the issue, etc.?\\nafter the admissions committee reviews and evaluates the online application, it may choose one of two (2) options:\\n\\ndecide not to accept the application and recommend other courses of action to improve the idea for resubmission, suggest other places it can find support, etc.; or, \\noffer stage one approval and ask the individual and/or team proponent(s) to attend an in-person pitch session with committee members \\n\\nproponents who are asked to pitch in person should prepare a basic slide deck (no more than ten slides) explaining their project and why it is a good fit for the social ventures zone.  each pitch should be no more than ten minutes long and will then be followed by up to 15 minutes of questions from the committee.  for an example of a template presentation, check out guy kawasaki's pitch guidelines (external link) . \\nin the event that the venture is not accepted, the committee will provide the proponents with feedback as to why and make suggestions, as appropriate, for further work on the concept, other places they may go for support, etc.\\nwhat makes an application to the social ventures zone successful?\\nthe social ventures zone receives dozens of applications for each round of admissions and our admissions committee selects the ones that best fit the criteria for admission. but in addition to the criteria outlined above, we often receive applications that are rejected because they fall into the following categories:\\n\\nventures that are not true social ventures, but rather businesses that have some social aspect.  for example, if your idea is to build a new dating app but donate a portion of proceeds to charity, that does not meet our definition of a social venture because it does not have a social issue at the core of its operations. \\ninnovators who do not sufficiently support their idea.  we sometimes receive pitches from innovators who propose what looks like an innovative idea but they do not support it with research, an organizational model or a basic understanding of the population it will help, etc. \\nideas that are better suited to a community group or student club.  while social progress often comes from the dialogue and connections that happen in groups of volunteers, such groups are not per se a social venture. \\n\\nhow do i apply?\\ninnovators can join the social ventures zone as one of three cohorts we accept each year. to determine whether applications are currently open or when they might be, check here.\\nshould you have questions or need assistance completing the application, you are welcome to call 416-979-5000 ext. 7255 or email socialventures@torontomu.ca.\\nhow much does it cost to join the social ventures zone?\\nthere is no cost involved to apply to the social ventures zone and successful ventures are not charged a fee once accepted.  ventures accepted into the zone are provided with free access to resources, professional advice, funding opportunities, skill development, and ongoing mentorship from successful community innovators and social entrepreneurs.\\nhow much time do i need to commit to participate in the social ventures zone?\\nventure team members are expected to contribute a minimum of 10-12 hours per month to their social enterprise.  this includes your participation in workshops and modules, time dedicated to your venture, and ongoing peer-to-peer collaboration.\\non that note, we believe in helping, not holding back. while focus is a good thing, we know that innovators sometimes need encouragement.  they need to know others believe in them and can pitch in to help, when needed.  that is why we want the social ventures zone to be a space where we actively look for opportunities to help our fellow innovators when we see them facing a challenge.  because what we give, we get back.\\nwhere is the social ventures zone located?\\nwe are located at 40 gould street, kerr hall south 45 (khs 045). you can find the entrance under the arches across from balzac's on gould street.\\nwhat if i don't have a good idea but want to get involved?\\nthe social ventures zone offers a supportive environment for ideas that are at least partially formed, have a team and are ready to put more work into moving their venture forward.  but we welcome people whose idea is still in the early stages or who would like to learn more about social enterprise, entrepreneurship and community change.  we offer the following opportunities to:\\n\\ndevelop ideas and formulate a plan through degree credit courses such as ssh400.  \\n\\n\\njoin an ideation cohort at the zone and develop your initial idea into a pitch-worthy one!  each term, we accept a small number of innovators who want to improve their ideas through a regular series of ideation sessions.  for more information, contact socialventures@torontomu.ca \\n\\n\\nget inspired at special events, speakers' series, and workshops hosted across campus. check out zone learning and the office of social innovation websites for upcoming events. \\n\\nsocial enterprises that are already in the social ventures zone also regularly looking

brampton. why brampton?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntmu selected brampton as the location for the school of medicine because the community is diverse, resilient, innovative and a microcosm of what communities will look like across canada in the future. \\nwe are building this medical school with the communities it will serve. brampton residents, community agencies and health partners have all provided unwavering support in project approvals, planning, and development so we will be ready to welcome our first cohort of medical students and residents in 2025. \\nbrampton's population has increased rapidly and the region's growth has been shaped by immigration. it is also a region of the province that has been chronically underfunded and has been hit by a higher rate of occurrence of covid-19.\\nin addition, brampton and toronto metropolitan university have existing partnerships through several initiatives, including the cybersecure catalyst, and brampton ventures zone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            where in brampton will the school of medicine be located? why was this location chosen?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe bramalea civic centre in brampton-peel has been selected as the future site of tmu's school of medicine.\\nthe bramalea civic centre was chosen for its proximity to both the brampton civic and peel memorial hospitals as well as its accessibility to municipal transportation, go transit and highway systems the site is also close to a variety of services and amenities to support the needs and well-being of our students, faculty and staff; it provides ready access to green space and active transportation infrastructure, such as walking and biking trails. \\nthe site also meets the space requirements to build a school of medicine that will require 250,000 square feet for classrooms, offices, research facilities and an integrated health clinic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            why is toronto metropolitan university interested in a medical school?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntoronto metropolitan university believes it can offer a new approach to medical education in ontario -- one that draws on the university's commitment to community, diversity and inclusion, and innovation to address the changing needs for health care delivery and practice.\\nbuilding on the strength and foundation of deep and broad community and industry partnerships, tmu is ideally situated to shape the future of health care. the university's new approach to medical education will meet the current pain points in the healthcare system, which have been exacerbated by the global pandemic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            does toronto metropolitan university have the expertise and academic programming experience needed to open a medical school?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntoronto metropolitan university is known for its focus on excellence in health across various faculties and departments. for example, the academic programs in areas such as psychology, nursing, social work, occupational health and safety, midwifery, biomedical engineering, physics (medical physics) and biology and chemistry are all major contributors to the university's regional and national presence in the health field based on their magnitude of research and their undergraduate and graduate enrolments. a new school of medicine will build on this foundation of excellence and leadership in health education.\\ntmu is distinctly solutions-oriented, demonstrated through its teaching, research and community partnerships. the university is deeply engaged with unity health and with st michael's hospital, where its labs in the hospital's research wing support on-site collaboration between clinical needs and bio-engineering know-how. the institute of biomedical engineering, science and technology (external link)  (ibest), the biomedical zone (bmz), and the medtech talent accelerator, (external link)  are examples of successful innovative collaborations. tmu is also home to the national institute of ageing and the healthcare user experience lab.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            is toronto metropolitan university partnering with any hospital in brampton?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwilliam osler health system (external link, opens in new

professional development.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how will the school of medicine address equity, diversity and inclusion (edi)?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nequity, diversity and inclusion (edi) and reconciliation will be intentionally infused throughout all facets of the tmu school of medicine, including: \\n\\nadmissions; \\nfaculty and staff recruitment; \\neducational programming; \\nthe learning environment; \\ncurriculum; \\nscholarly, research and creative (src) activities; \\nenterprise; and \\npatient, family, and community engagement. \\n\\nwe will continually foster a culture of inclusion and engagement and advance social justice. the tmu school of medicine will be the first medical school in canada founded and intentionally built upon the foundations of social accountability, edi and reconciliation. \\nto facilitate the integration of edi into all aspects of the planning and program development process, a school of medicine edi advisory committee was established to create an edi strategy and action plan. the resulting plan has also been endorsed by the academic program development committee  \\nthis work is also guided by the school of medicine's equity, diversity and inclusion values statement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how will the school of medicine address truth and reconciliation?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na vital component of the truth and reconciliation process is public recognition of the tragic and painful history and the ongoing impacts of residential schools.\\nour university has been on its own path of truth and reconciliation with the work of the  (pdf file) standing strong task force. as a starting point, we draw inspiration from the  (pdf file) truth and reconciliation commission's final report (external link)  and in particular calls to action 18 through 24, which specifically address the need for action for indigenous health. of these, calls to action 22 through 24 are the most relevant to medical school contexts. in particular, they address the need for indigenous understandings of health and well-being, a holistic admissions process and the creation of pathway programs for indigenous learners.\\nin addition, the association of faculties of medicine of canada's indigenous working group has provided a crucial roadmap for the implementation of the truth and reconciliation commission calls to action in their  (pdf file) joint commitment to action on indigenous health (external link) . their report highlights the importance of accountability and of thoughtful, reciprocal relationships with indigenous communities to advance reconciliation and indigenous health.\\nboth documents serve as an important reminder of the need to form respectful, reciprocal, long-term relationships with indigenous-led organizations early in the planning process to set the foundation for a meaningful commitment to action. the university is committed to developing meaningful relationships with indigenous communities through a co-creation approach to define the terms of the relationship and ensuring accountability mechanisms are in place. we recognize that co-creation is a long-term process of relationship- and trust-building.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntmu is committed to developing a shared culture between both campuses, building on tmu's strengths in edi, social justice and research and innovation. \\nstudents and faculty at the medical school will be able to access relevant resources and supports at our downtown campus. the school of medicine will also ensure that local supports are available, specific to the needs of medical students at the brampton campus location. \\nbuilding on the school of medicine's pillar of innovation, the site in brampton will leverage technology to support students with virtual

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nafter broad community engagement and extensive research, the university's standing strong (mash koh wee kah pooh win) task force recommended that the university be renamed to better align with institutional values. \\nthe recommendation and subsequent decision to rename was not based on a vilification of egerton ryerson but instead was based on the understanding that a new name is necessary to create a more inclusive campus culture and environment. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how did the university go about the renaming process?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfollowing the board of governors' august 2021 decision to accept the standing strong task force recommendations, president lachemi announced our commitment to determining a new name by the end of the 2021/22 academic year. to reach this goal, the university renaming advisory committee (urac) was established. \\nin april 2022, the urac concluded their community and expert informed process and submitted a shortlist of possible names for president lachemi's consideration. after careful deliberation, one of the names was recommended to the board of governors for approval. \\nfor more information on the renaming process, please visit the university renaming webpage. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n

and registered immediately upon approval by the board of governors on april 26, 2022, the overall transition to the new name is happening in phases.  \\nsome university materials changed immediately, such as webpages and social media handles, while other changes, such as external signage on campus buildings and amendments to legal documents, including degrees, will take longer.\\nthe ontario legislature voted to amend the ryerson university act on december 1, 2022, allowing the new name to be reflected on legal documents issued by the university.\\non december 8, 2022 the amendment received royal assent from the lieutenant governor, legally changing our university's name to toronto metropolitan university.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how

iterative community engagement to reconsider the former mascot, eggy the ram, the university announced that a new mascot and team name would be determined. on august 29, 2022 the new team, tmu bold,

worthy of promotion. alumni are certainly encouraged to keep and display their old degrees with pride, if they are comfortable doing so. \\nthe university understands that not all alumni may want to keep their degree issued under our former name. alumni who wish to have their degree reissued under our new name can do so. this is a service the university has always offered and alumni will continue to have this option now that we have been renamed toronto metropolitan university. \\nmore details on this will be posted to the curriculum advising webpage when

licensed to give supervision, care and advice to clients during pregnancy, labour and the postpartum period, to conduct deliveries on their own and to care for the newborn child.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            2. how do midwives in ontario work?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmidwives usually work in communitybased group practices. they attend births in hospitals, at client's homes, and in birth centres. they provide care throughout pregnancy, labour, birth and up to six weeks postpartum to the client and their baby.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            3. do i need to be a nurse before i can become a midwife?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nno. midwifery is an autonomous profession separate and distinct from nursing and medicine. while there are basic skills that are common to all three professions, midwifery has a unique scope of practice and model of care.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            4. what type of educational background do students who are accepted to the program typically have?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmidwifery students come from a wide variety of educational backgrounds. many of them have received previous university undergraduate degrees while others have graduate degrees, college diplomas, or are mature students. prospective students are strongly recommended to have completed a minimum of one year of university education.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            5. what are my chances of acceptance into the program with little or no experience in the health field?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npast experience may be taken into account during the selection process, but it is by no means a necessary requirement for acceptance into the program. applicants are assessed for those qualities that will enable the individual to become a good midwife.  places in the program have been offered to applicants from many different walks of life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            6. what is the earning potential for a midwife in ontario?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nplease consult the association of ontario midwives for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            7. what is the employment outlook for students on completing the program?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwith demand for midwives exceeding supply, there are many opportunities for graduates to fill positions in ontario and other provinces in canada. once students complete the program, they must write the canadian midwifery registration exam (cmre) and then they are eligible to apply to the college of midwives of ontario for registration and are required to work in an established midwifery practice for one year. toronto metropolitan university graduates have successfully found positions in midwifery practices across ontario and other parts of canada.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            8. what's the philosophy of the program?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe educational program is based on the following beliefs and values:  we believe that midwifery has the potential to be one of the most important components of women's health care in ontario. midwives' expertise in the care of normal pregnancy and childbirth arises from their understanding of childbearing as a social, cultural and biological process and from their ability to competently exercise clinical skills and decision-making. midwifery education must provide the base for sound professional practice.  we believe that midwives are the best persons to teach the professional practice of midwifery. in addition we believe that the educational program has a special responsibility to foster partnerships between midwives and other health care providers for the benefit of students and women who seek midwifery care.  we believe the educational program is an integral part of the evolution of the profession of midwifery in ontario and canada. the program must help create future leaders and teachers. it must establish practice and teaching as a continuum so that learning environments become available across ontario.  we believe the educational program will best assure the acquisition of knowledge, skills and values, and foster critical thinking if the academic setting is respectful of students, is committed to scholarly enquiry and emphasized the lifelong ability to learn and change.  we believe that accessible education, which is both flexible and culturally sensitive, requires high quality distance education.  we believe that the collaborative model of program development and management described herein provides both a reflection of and a model for professional practice in the field of midwifery.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            9. where can i find the supplementary application form used in midwifery?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin addition to meeting the competitive academic requirements for the program, mep applicants are required to submit the midwifery self-id and admissions survey. the survey is used to gather information on applicants' clinical placement region preferences and their desire to participate in the voluntary equity admissions self-id and/or indigenous admissions processes. the survey is due by february 1st and is access through an applicant's choosetmu applicant portal\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n    quick links\\r\\n

 i\\'ve heard gmail search is really powerful. how does it work?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nto search for messages, type a word that the messages contain. note, however, that search matches \"whole words\" only--that is, it doesn\\'t recognize partial or similar matches. for example, if you search for benefits, search won\\'t find benefit or benef. also, search doesn\\'t recognize special search characters, such as square brackets, parentheses, currency symbols, the ampersand, the pound sign, and asterisks.\\nby default, search doesn\\'t look in your trash or spam folders. to search those folders also, click show search options next to the search field, and then, in the search drop-down list, select mail & spam & trash. you can find more information about using search in the gmail help center (external link) .\\na list of the advanced search operators is available in the gmail help center (external link) . you can also print out  (pdf file) pdf

     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyour account has unlimited storage. you\\'ll probably never run out of space. in fact, a heavy email user who sends and receives lots of file attachments and archives all messages might use up to 5% of this space a year (usually less), so it would take decades to use up all of the available space. also note that google apps restricts the size of file attachments to 20 mb, so you don\\'t have to worry about a few large files using up your storage space.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            keyboard shortcuts\\r\\n

as a workaround, you can create your own mailing list (called a \"group\") for all the employees who want to share an email address. this requires that your administrator has enabled user-managed groups for your domain. if user-managed groups aren\\'t available, then you should ask your google apps administrator to set up a mailing list (group) for all the employees who want to share an email address.\\nor if email delegation is enabled for your domain, you can use that to allow up to 10 other users access a single email account.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n

symbols, the ampersand, the pound sign, and asterisks.\\nby default, search doesn\\'t look in your trash or spam folders. to search those folders also, click show search options next to the search

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngoogle has launched a new menu of services called \"add-ons for docs and sheets\". add-ons are applications created by third-parties (non-google and non-tmu) and have the ability to interact with your google apps for edu account (your tmu gmail, calendar and google drive, and other google apps for edu services). \\nindividuals cannot turn on the ability to install these services. they must either be enabled for everyone by tmu or for no one. working with the privacy and security officers, ccs has been investigating whether these services should be enabled at tmu. \\neach add-on requires the person who used it to agree to permissions such as granting the third party the ability to view and manage your email or send email on your behalf.\\n the third parties also have separate terms of service from tmu\\'s contract with google. this means that these applications are not covered by our agreement with google, which raises privacy, security, legal and records management concerns.  \\nit also means that the privacy and security requirements we have established for the core google apps for edu services may not be met by these third-party applications. \\nfor example, while testing, we discovered that some of these applications do not support tmu\\'s expectation of \"privacy as a default setting,\" one of the seven principles of privacy by design (external link) . \\nas a result of all of these risk factors, we have decided not to enable the ability to install add-ons in google apps for edu at tmu.\\nplease note that by design from google, tmu users will always see the \"add-ons\" menu while in a google doc or spreadsheet and while users can browse these add-ons, they will not be able to install and use them since tmu\\'s google apps administrators in ccs have not enabled this service for tmu.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n    import files\\r\\n    \\r\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nopen

                  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntmu uses central authentication service (cas) as our single sign on (sso) solution. it\\'s used to access my.torontomu portal, google apps for tmu and many other web applications.  for security reasons and to help mitigate phishing attacks, it is important that users are able to view the url of the cas login page in the browser address bar. hence, we do not allow cas login page to be embedded in other web pages, for example, via an inline frame (iframe). and we have mechanism in place to break out of embedded pages such as iframes.  in such cases, you will get  \"authentication required\" cas page.\\nsites often embed google technologies in them, such as google calendar, google forms  and google maps etc.  some of these want to retrieve your google data (your avatar, gmail address etc), so google tries to authenticate you.  depends on your google authentication session, if it has timed out, you will be redirected to google login page.  if you\\'ve used google apps for tmu, you will be redirected to cas login page.  as these all happened in the embedded iframe, cas breaks out of the frame and present you with the \"authentication required\" page.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            i have gone to my.torontomu.ca and logged in. when i click the \"manage my

permanently in late 2020, classic hangouts will remain available through the web by going to hangouts.google.com (external link) . within gmail, the new google chat will appear in place of the classic hangouts. there is no option to revert back to classic hangouts in gmail. direct messages sent in classic hangouts or google chat can be viewed and replied to in the other service. group messages in classic hangouts or google chat can\\'t be viewed or replied to in the other service. if you would like to continue group messages in the new google chat, you will have to recreate the group chats in

gmail, you can now use google meet to make phone calls instead. in terms of voice calls and text messaging (sms), this feature is now offered via google voice (google voice is not available at tmu).

fippa\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q1: what do i do if i suspect a privacy breach?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:  toronto metropolitan university (\"tmu\") has a privacy incident notification process.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q2: what is fippa and what are its fundamental principles?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:    fippa is provincial legislation that has applied to ontario universities, including toronto metropolitan university (\"tmu\") since june 10, 2006. fippa is composed of two principles of equal weight:  \\n\\ntransparency: access to information is an essential value\\nprivacy: personal information and privacy must be protected and doing so is integral to the dignity and the integrity of the individual\\n\\nfippa applies to any records in tmu\\'s custody or control. certain records are excluded from fippa including:\\n\\nprivate donations to tmu\\'s archives\\nlabour relations and employment-related records leading to agreements\\nresearch and teaching materials\\nrecords not in the custody or control of tmu\\n\\nthere are specific exemptions to the obligation to disclose records, for example:\\n\\npersonal information\\nclosed meetings\\nsolicitor-client documents\\neconomic and other interests of tmu\\nthird-party information\\nadvice and recommendations\\ndanger to health and safety\\npublicly-available documents\\nlaw enforcement\\nrelations with governments\\n\\nfippa contains particular requirements for the collection, use, protection and disclosure of personal information.  individuals have the right to ask for your own personal information and to request a correction of records containing your own personal information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q3: are there any general guiding principles that will help me make appropriate decisions when it comes to freedom of information and privacy?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:    \\n\\nfippa requires that personal information and privacy must be protected \\nwhen it comes to creating records (including email and paper documents) consider the possibility that what you are writing could be subject to an access request and therefore could be made public--what would the impact be on your reputation or tmu\\'s? \\nwhen someone asks you for another person\\'s information, consider whether it is personal information, and if so, don\\'t provide it. \\nwhen you are using, storing, duplicating or destroying personal information, take reasonable steps to secure the information, e.g. password protect, locked file cabinets, confidential shredding, personal and confidential envelopes rather than email, not leaving documents sitting out on a desk where unauthorized people might have access. \\nreview your files and emails regularly. if you have documents that you don\\'t need and are under no policy or legal obligation to keep, then destroy them. \\nuse common sense and good judgment. if you have specific questions ask your chair or email the privacy officer. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q4: what are some best practices i can follow to minimize security and privacy breaches?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:    take the following actions: \\n\\nreview employee procedures in the information protection and access policy for restricted information \\ntake information security awareness training \\nif you are collecting, using, and/or storing other individuals\\' personal information (i.e. students or research subjects) \\n  \\nalways use password-protection \\npassword protect your laptop and do not store data on the local drive, use a secure shared drive.\\n \\nbe extra careful when sharing personal information via email - make sure the address is correct and include only the minimal information necessary to complete the task.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q5: i\\'ve lost my laptop and it contained student records, my lectures and some research. what do i do?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:    call security to report at 416.979.5040.  tell them if your computer contained personal information on the hard drive, whether the machine was password protected and whether the data was encrypted.  \\nif there was data on the machine that consists of personal information (student grades, assignments, employee records, research containing other individuals\\' personal information) you are required by university policy to contact the privacy officer immediately at fippa@torontomu.ca.  this is a suspected privacy breach.\\nif the machine was password protected and the personal information data was encrypted this is not a breach and no further action is required.  if you did not use these precautions then you will be involved in notifying all affected individuals about the breach.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q6: who is responsible when material intended for shredding is involved in a privacy breach?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:    if you are the source, user, or keeper of the record then you are responsible for ensuring the information\\'s secure return or destruction once you are finished with it - think \"cradle to grave\" responsibility.\\n\\ntalk to your department to find out about access to a shredder or to arrange for shredding of confidential records through campus facilities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q7: what should i do if i am asked to provide information that i believe is protected under fippa?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:    in general, if you are asked for information that you would normally provide, such as a course syllabus or outline, a reading list, or a copy of an article you should provide that information. you must also provide information that is about the requestor, such as grades on tests and papers. you should not provide a third party with any personal information. you also do not need to provide such things as exam questions, teaching materials or research notes, as these are excluded. if you have a question you may contact tmu\\'s privacy officer at fippa@torontomu.ca. if you choose not to honour a request for information, the requestor has a right to file a freedom of information request. in the latter case, it will be tmu\\'s privacy officer, who determines access to the information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q8: what happens when tmu receives a request under fippa for access to information?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:    an access request must be made to tmu\\'s privacy officer and requires a $5.00 application fee. the privacy officer determines where the requested information is held and will work with the fippa contact in that area to find the records requested and to determine if any exclusions or exemptions apply. fees are charged to the requestor for the time taken to search for and, if appropriate, prepare records for release.  if the information is to be given to the requestor, the privacy officer redacts any personal information, or other excluded information from the record before it is disclosed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q9: can someone use fippa to access my professional records created as part of consulting work i do outside my regular employment with the university?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:    fippa applies to records that are in the custody and control of the university. it should not apply to records that are personal to you (including business activities unrelated to the university). however, if you don\\'t keep those records separate from your university records, it is possible that confusion could occur as to what is actually the university\\'s and what is yours. a best practice is to keep these separate and clearly mark those files that do not belong to the university (e.g. separate file cabinet, separate folders on computer and email).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q10: what types of student and general records do i need to retain and for how long?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:    \\ntransitory records \\nthe following are considered to be transitory records that can and should be disposed of when no longer needed: \\n\\nduplicate stocks of publications, printed literature or blank forms, including those associated with computer-based information systems;\\nduplicate records within the same media retained solely for convenient reference or future distribution (examples include branch-wide memos; \"all staff\" e-mails; notices of holidays, special events or routine administrative matters; and personal desk copies of such items as program studies or committee minutes);\\nbroadly distributed materials (such as manuals, directives, bulletins and guidelines) used to communicate policies and practices for internal administration (other than original copies kept by the office from which the materials were issued);\\nphone messages, personal messages, and records documenting activities such as holiday parties or charitable fund drives unconnected to program functions; \\nunsolicited advertising materials;\\npublications such as books, journals, magazines, newspapers, newsletters, and published reports which form or will form part of a library\\'s catalogued holdings or are stored within branch libraries or reference shelves;\\npublication extracts which have no significant value in documenting how program data was collected or decisions reached, and which have not therefore been integrated within program files;\\ntemporary working papers such as rough notes or informal drafts that are of no value in documenting data collection or in showing how tmu policies or programs were developed or implemented. (that is, they represent no significant steps in the preparation of a final document, were not reviewed by other persons, do not record program decisions, and do not contain important research or background data.)\\nmanagers should ensure that all transitory items are deleted or destroyed immediately when no longer needed.\\n\\n official tmu records \\nofficial records are distinct from transitory records. official records serve important business functions, such as supporting program delivery or policy development, or meeting legal, financial and other needs. they may also provide important evidence of institutional decisions and actions. these should only be destroyed in accordance with with tmu\\'s record retention schedule (see records management policy).\\nrecords containing personal information \\nanything which has personal information must be retained for a minimum of one year under fippa. personal information includes, but is not limited to: name, home address, home phone number, student\\'s email address (home or tmu), identifying numbers (e.g. student number, employee number or social insurance number), education history (grades, degrees received, academic misconduct) health history, or opinions about an individual.  your professional contact information is generally not perceived as personal information (faculty\\'s business phone number, tmu email, business mailing address). see the definition of \"personal information\" in the freedom of information and protection of privacy act available on the general counsel\\'s information access and privacy website.  \\naccording to tmu\\'s course management policy 166, all student work is to be returned to the student before the end of the academic term.  final exams and unclaimed assignments are the only type of student work that, under fippa, will need to be retained for the one-year period because these are not returned to students.  \\nyou should also retain all documents and correspondence that may be part of the academic or academic conduct appeals process. you are required by the course management policy to submit a copy of your grade sheet to the department/school.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q11: what should be my e-mail protocol and retention in regard to correspondence with students?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:   all emails from and to students that contain personal information as described above and that you use for the purpose of evaluating their contributions during a course or for advising regarding their educational path should be retained for one year under fippa.  particular emphasis is placed upon retaining correspondence that reveals something personal about the student beyond their email address (student id, educational or medical history, financial information, questions about course work, evaluations, etc.).  this also includes any correspondence that may pertain to an appeal.  you should only correspond with students on their \"ryerson.ca\" email accounts as per tmu\\'s policy for the establishment of student email accounts for official university communication 157.\\nyou should be careful about the content of e-mails as they may be retained not only by you but by others, and they can be requested as part of an foi request. generally, the \"reply all\" response should be avoided unless it is necessary. you can never be assured of what is retained by others; so, even if you have deleted an email, that\\'s no guarantee it will not end up being released as a result of an foi request.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q12: can i send multiple students one email using their tmu email address and what are other methods of communication i can use to communicate with groups of students?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:    a tmu student\\'s email address is considered their personal information and as such faculty should take care in the use of these addresses. \\nall students are provided with an official tmu email address, as per senate policy #157, establishment of student email accounts for official university communication, as a means by which ryerson employees can communicate with students.  the address is also a means by which tmu can foster a collaborative learning environment such as through student discussion groups on d2l brightspace.  there are no restrictions on how students can use their email address, such as for personal communications, or for communications outside tmu. \\nfaculty and staff, however, should take care in using student email addresses.  be cautious in sending group emails; disclosing personal information such as grades, internship placements, home contact information, or details about an academic appeal to other students as these situations would all constitute a privacy breach and tmu\\'s privacy officer must be notified immediately. \\nif you want to send a group email and the text does not identify individuals, consider using the blind-copying function. refrain from disclosing the student\\'s email address to non-tmu personnel unless you have the consent of the student.  \\nusing d2l brightspace to post general information messages to students is one low-risk option.  for messages aimed at a specific group of students within a course try using the blind-copying function on your email system; this way students can only see their own address and cannot see who else received the message.  it is important to note that the content of the message should dictate the method used to communicate information to students; the more sensitive the information, the less appropriate group communication, including email will be.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q13: what should be my e-mail protocol and retention in regard to correspondence with other faculty and administration?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:    the same general advice applies with regards to emails with students. email is not considered a secure or an appropriate vehicle for communicating highly sensitive information.  emails containing personal information that you have used, needs to be retained for a minimum of one year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q14: am i entitled to access to students\\' academic records for any reason?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:    in general, you do not have the right to consult a student\\'s academic record. faculty who serve on appeals panels or who are charged with academic advising may confidentially access these records for that purpose only. chairs/directors and their specified administrative staff may access records for administrative purposes only and are not authorized to share that record with faculty. if you have questions regarding whether you may access an academic record for a particular purpose speak to the associate registrar, enrollment services.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q15: what should i do with unclaimed students\\' work?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:    the course management policy states that students\\' work must be returned to them confidentially. putting student work in a box outside your office is not permitted.  departments/schools are required to develop policies on the confidential disposal of work.  under fippa you must retain all unclaimed student work, including final exams, for one year from the date received.  student grades and evaluation comments should be kept confidential.  it is advisable not to put the mark and comments on the front page of the document.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q16: can i have students working in groups hand in one assignment together with their names and their tmu student identification numbers on the first page?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:    the concern is that name plus student id number permits someone else with enough information to impersonate another student.  the more information disclosed, the better able some one would be in committing fraud.  a similar approach to that outlined in the course management policy section 2.2(f) should be followed where only part of the student number is included. it is recommended that the last 4 digits be used.  in other words, professors can request that students working on group assignments hand in projects listing a portion of the student id number and no names.  in this way the other students in the group will not be privy to the entire student id number.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q17: how can i now take students\\' attendance at weekly classes and final exams? what if the student doesn\\'t have their onecard?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:    attendance at lectures, seminars and labs can still be taken, but professors should be sensitive to how this information is gathered. the student\\'s full name and complete student id number should not be circulated. \\nfor final exams, invigilators should walk around the room to verify student photo id cards on a student-by-student basis, noting the attendance on a sheet of names and numbers, and students should sign their individual exams.   \\naccording to the senate\\'s examination policy 135, section iii (b)(5) students must present relevant photo identification; the policy does not specify that only the onecard will suffice.  there is no need to take a student\\'s photograph at an exam.  it is the student\\'s responsibility to ensure that he/she brings proper identification.  if a student does not have any photo id, the instructor should first try to confirm that the student is in the class, and the student should be required to bring identification with a signature to the instructor\\'s office as soon as possible after the exam.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q18: what can an instructor do upon becoming aware that a student is taking photos or video of the lecture, other students, or discussion period? is this a violation of student privacy? what about the instructors\\' privacy?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:    students\\' answers, student images - these are the personal information of students.  the actual lecture is the teaching material of the instructor and is not meant to be publicly available without his/her consent; teaching materials are protected against disclosure from a formal access request under fippa.  the image of the instructor is his/her personal information therefore both the instructor\\'s lecture and image would require the instructor\\'s consent for capture.\\nif notice about the intent to capture the lecture by audio or visual recording is provided in advance to the instructor and students, no one\\'s privacy would be violated.  students with concerns could approach the instructor in advance.  if the request to record the lecture stems from an access centre request, then these concerns would be relayed to the access centre.  tmu is obliged under the ontario human rights code and the accessibility for ontarians with disabilities act (bill 118) to seek a reasonable accommodation so that students with disabilities are not at a learning disadvantage.  please contact the access centre for further information (ext. 5290).  see also the senate policy academic accomodation of students with disabilities 159\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q19: in award ceremonies where donors recognize student achievements, how do we protect student privacy? do we need students\\' consent to disclose personal information about them to the donor? photos? announcements? newsletters? what if the donor wants to take the information and publish it elsewhere?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:    for awards applied through tmu\\'s student financial assistance as of april 2008 there is a notice of collection in place that covers this use. \\nfor all other awards, or other kinds of student achievements, departments are advised to contact students in advance to obtain their permission to use their personal information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q20: can students see their internship or practicum evaluations submitted by third-parties (such as a doctor)?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:    the letter is comparable in purpose to a professor\\'s feedback on an assignment and therefore the student has a right to see it.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q21: should i agree to write letters of recommendation for students or colleagues?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:    yes, if you would have done so prior to fippa you should do it now. fippa exempts evaluative or opinion material of the type that assesses the teaching materials or research of an employee, or determines eligibility or qualification for admission to an academic program, or determines the qualification for an honour or award to recognize achievement. if the person who is being evaluated uses fippa to request access to their own personal information in that evaluation or opinion material, ryerson has the discretion to refuse that request.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q22: how is my research impacted by fippa?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:    research and teaching materials are excluded from fippa.  thus, if someone were to make an foi request for your research notes on a project, the university would advise the requestor that those records are not subject to fippa. however, fippa specifies that the subject matter and the amount of funding for research (but not the source of funding) is information that must be made available if requested. for more information consult with ovpri.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q23: how is the process of peer review affected by fippa?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:    fippa exempts evaluative or opinion material of the type that assesses the teaching materials or research of an employee, or determines eligibility or qualification for admission to an academic program, or determines the qualification for an honour or award to recognize achievement. if the person who is being evaluated uses fippa to request access to their own personal information in that evaluation or opinion material, ryerson has the discretion to refuse that request.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            q24: how are the hiring and promotion and tenure review processes affected by fippa?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na:    the hiring, promotion and tenure review processes are governed by the collective agreement between toronto metropolitan university and the toronto metropolitan faculty association. collective agreements are accessible under fippa and are available for public access.  the collective agreement itself provides for certain access to information rights. for more information speak with the vice provost, faculty affairs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nneed more

                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na cgpa is your cumulative grade point average.\\nentrance scholarship renewals assess your cgpa from the end of the most recent winter semester. your cgpa is the average of all your course grades to date, not individual year, or semester gpas.\\nyou can see your cgpa at the end of each semester by going to your student centre in myservicehub and selecting \"grades.\" then select the appropriate winter term, and at the top, you will be able to see your cumulative total at the end of that

enrolled in an 80% course load (four or more billing units) in both fall and winter terms. students who withdraw, discontinue their program, reduce their course load, experience a decline in grades below the minimum cgpa requirement, or no longer meet other scholarship/award requirements may forfeit all or part of their award. \\nthe decision is made by the student awards and scholarships office and is based on the terms of the scholarship. a cancelled scholarship may result in a charge against the student\\'s university fee account.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n

calendar years after you receive the initial scholarship. if you do not receive it one year, but maintain or increase your cgpa the next, in addition to upholding all other renewal criteria, there is the potential to have it reinstated at the beginning of the next academic year (i.e. september). \\nplease note that the loss of a scholarship one year, does not extend the eligibility time

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nscholarships are renewable for three calendar years from the term of admission only, and will be renewed consecutively. scholarship renewals occur in the fall semester of each academic year and the total value for the year is disbursed evenly between the fall and winter semesters. \\napplicable only to tmu\\'s guaranteed entrance and renewable scholarships, entrance scholarship renewals may be applied to student accounts in three consecutive fall and winter terms, regardless of when their co-op placements fall. your most recent winter cgpa will be used in the calculation of the renewal amount.\\nparticipating in a co-op program that extends your studies to five years does not extend your scholarship eligibility by an extra year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            8. what if i am a student with an accommodation for a reduced course load? can i still receive my scholarship?\\r\\n

units per term) as part of your academic accommodation plan, you can receive a prorated scholarship value, with an extended eligibility time frame. the cgpa and academic standing requirements will still need to be achieved. \\nyou will need to self-disclose your reduced course load academic accommodation in confidence to awards@torontomu.ca by september 27, 2024 for the fall semester and by january 24, 2025 for the winter semester (you will need to email us in both semesters as a result of the volume of student accounts we oversee for renewal).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n

the cgpa requirement for scholarship renewals is a firm condition. that being said, if you are able to increase your cgpa above the minimum requirement during the next academic year, your account will be reviewed for renewal the next fall.\\nif you are the recipient of a president\\'s entrance scholarship, and your cgpa falls within 0.25 points of 3.67, you may be granted a probationary scholarship renewal period where you will conditionally receive half your scholarship in the fall semester, with the expectation that you will increase your cgpa above a 3.67 to receive the rest in winter.\\nper senate policy 170(a), your gpa is rounded up to the next higher second decimal place. for example, a 3.8477 would round to a 3.85.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            10.

to put into practice as a result of what they have learned in the program. they are a series of measurable statements which, taken together, describe what graduates can do with the learned body of knowledge, the set of skills, and the attitudes or values considered important for success in the discipline. program learning outcomes also clarify the program\\'s purpose and objectives for students and instructors in order to improve communication, shared expectations, and program coherence.\\neffective program learning outcomes can be observed and/or assessed. rather than describing what the instructor will do or cover in a course, program learning outcomes describe what knowledge, skills, and values graduates will be able to demonstrate through presentation, discussion, action, or in projects and assignments. \\ncurriculum specialists are available to provide guidance and support when developing or revising all program learning outcomes for new and existing programs. please

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfor departments and schools, learning outcomes provide a roadmap for curriculum, and a goal post for student achievement. they serve as essential reference points for academic departments to discuss the elements that contribute to an integrated program of study. the ontario quality framework requires programs to be intentional about the choice and development of their program outcomes and to clearly communicate their roadmap for student learning.\\nfor instructors, program learning outcomes provide a broad picture of the program and offer insights into how each course and other program experiences contribute to the development of the knowledge, skills, and values/attitudes expected of their graduates. \\nfor students, program learning outcomes communicate the skills successful graduates will develop, and the types of knowledge they learn in preparation for employment, further education, and to participate as critically informed citizens. \\nfor employers, program learning outcomes outline what they can confidently expect from potential employees.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what is the difference between program goals/objectives and program learning outcomes? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe difference between program objectives or goals and program outcomes is a difference in perspective. program goals or objectives are part of the planning process. they describe what a program plans or seeks to achieve. the focus is on what is promoted in and delivered by the program (e.g. broad areas of focus or approach(es), learning activities used, and experiences or opportunities offered). program objectives also help define what makes the program unique and meaningful, and ultimately provide direction and justification for program and course-level curricular decisions.\\nin contrast, program learning outcomes focus on the skills developed by graduates, outlining the knowledge, skills, and values/attitudes that a graduate will be able to demonstrate. rather than focus on the material that will be covered or the experiences they\\'ll have, program learning outcomes focus on how students understand and employ that material and the specific knowledge, skills and attitudes they will be able to demonstrate as a result. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncomparison of

   how are program learning outcomes used at toronto metropolitan university? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nprogram objectives and program learning outcomes are used at toronto metropolitan to guide the design and revision of all academic programs.\\nnew program development \\nall new program development involves developing program objectives, and identifying the skills, knowledge and capabilities of the intended graduate,  which are then refined into intended program learning outcomes. both the program objectives and the intended program learning outcomes should be developed before planning courses, or laying out the structure for a program. the courses, structures, and course elements should then be designed to provide students with the experiences required to achieve the program\\'s intended outcomes and to align with the program\\'s objectives. otherwise, it can be likened to designing a car by providing superb and highly specialized components first, and leaving it to students to make sense of how they may or may not fit together.\\nperiodic program review (ppr)\\nthe ppr process begins with a thorough review of the program objectives and program learning outcomes. program objectives are developed or updated to ensure that there are clear and relevant goals guiding what is promoted in and delivered by the program. program learning outcomes are reviewed and updated to ensure that they are demonstrable and represent the relevant, current, and discipline-specific knowledge, skills, and related attributes expected of program graduates. mapping courses to the program learning outcomes helps identify where and how outcomes are achieved, and supports the review of how the learning is delivered and assessed in the program.\\nmajor curriculum modification(s)\\nany major curriculum modification involves mapping the changes to both the ontario degree-level expectations (dles) and the program learning outcomes to ensure that sufficient coverage is achieved or maintained. mapping the modified curriculum helps to ensure that all changes support students\\' achievement of the program learning outcomes, and that there are no resulting gaps or inconsistencies. \\nstrong and intentional curricular design at each of these stages ensures learning is thoughtfully integrated and assessed throughout the program so that students can acquire the knowledge, skills, and values/attitudes needed to progress from one year to the next, and to succeed upon graduation.\\nbackwards design: once you have determined the knowledge, skills, values and attributes that graduates of your program should have, the next step is to articulate those skills in demonstrable and measurable program learning outcomes. the curriculum is then designed and developed to meet those outcomes. \\n\\nwiggins & mctighe\\'s understanding by design (2005) and \"backwards design\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n

program objectives and program learning outcomes for new programs should involve key faculty who will be responsible for delivering the program, and be informed by disciplinary experts, potential employers, and/or others as appropriate to the field. your curriculum specialist will provide support and guidance when developing objectives and learning outcomes for new programs. please contact us for additional information or support.\\nperiodic program review \\nrevising program goals and program learning outcomes for program review should include the core ppr team consisting of faculty members and an administrative assistant. the process will at times involve all faculty members who regularly teach the core components of the program. academic program delivery requires a collective commitment and shared responsibility. your curriculum specialist will provide support and guidance to the program when reviewing and revising program goals and program learning outcomes for ppr.

of all undergraduate and graduate degrees granted by ontario universities. dles indicate the knowledge and skill outcomes, reflecting levels of intellectual and creative development, at specified degree levels (i.e. bachelor's, master's, and doctoral). dles also help to ensure program learning outcomes are appropriate, degree-graduates meet the expected competencies of the credential, and the quality and value of the credential is comparable across institutions. all ontario universities have agreed to use ocav's guidelines as a threshold framework for their own degree-level expectations.\\ndles for undergraduate and graduate programs (external link)  are delineated into six broad categories:\\n\\ndepth and breadth of knowledge\\nknowledge of methodologies (undergrad) / research and scholarship (grad)\\napplication of knowledge\\ncommunication skills\\nawareness of limits of knowledge\\nautonomy and professional capacity\\n\\nspecific dle requirements for

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nat toronto metropolitan university, we have developed curriculum insights (ci), an easy-to-use online program to help faculty and instructors map their courses to the program's learning outcomes (plos), and generate full curriculum maps.\\n\\nas faculty and instructors map their course(s) to the plos, they also map the teaching methods and assessment methods to identify how students learn and are assessed on each outcome. mapping these methods helps to identify which methods are used most often, and to ensure the delivery and assessment methods support students' achievement of all program learning outcomes.\\n\\nour curriculum insights mapping program is used to visualize the curriculum and generate a range of curriculum reports. it facilitates ppr and can be used to plan curriculum modifications and to help with accreditation mapping.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what is the point of mapping the

mapping. in addition to generating a comprehensive curriculum map, ci also generates reports that map teaching and assessment methods, for incorporation into the ppr self-study.\\nanalysing the curriculum map with program instructors helps clarify and unify program expectations, facilitates collaborative planning, and helps the program plan future changes and enhancements to maintain the integrity and coherence of the program. analysing the program map in light of other ppr data points (e.g. student, alumni, and employer feedback; industry trends, advancements in the field; program advisory council feedback, etc.) also helps to identify and prioritize opportunities for program enhancement.\\ncontact your curriculum specialist for these resources and guidance with curriculum

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe ppr is intended to engage programs in reflection, analysis, and evaluation of the current state of the program curriculum, with the goal of continuous improvement. the program-wide lens supports curricular analysis and helps to identify:\\n\\nprogram strengths \\nareas for enhancement\\nprogram-specific evidence and metrics\\n\\nthis information informs and supports future curriculum modifications, thereby improving the quality of the learning experience for students. the prr self study is, therefore, both an analysis of a program's current state and development since the last review, as well as a planning tool in a forward-facing document meant to guide future development.\\nmore broadly, the objective of ppr is to examine the quality of degree programs to ensure that they achieve and maintain the highest possible standards of academic excellence and continue to satisfy societal need.  although the ppr process and requirements are guided by ryerson's iqap, the creation of the ppr self-study is program-led and involves the contributions of faculty, staff, students, and program stakeholders.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n

periodic program review.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            when is my program scheduled to begin its ppr?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nundergraduate and graduate programs are reviewed on an eight year cycle. part-time programs are reviewed at the same time as full-time programs. the  (pdf file) undergraduate ppr schedule (opens in new window)  and graduate ppr schedule (opens in new window)  list the year in which each program is expected to start its next review.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what is the timeline for completing a ppr? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe two stages of program review should take approximately 18-20 months to complete.\\nstage 1, the preparation of a self-study document by the program, takes approximately 12 months. to facilitate timely completion, the office of the vice provost academic provides resources and support to programs throughout the ppr process.\\nstage 2, which involves reviews, approvals, and a visit from a peer-review team, takes roughly an additional 8 months.\\nthe undergraduate ppr manual includes a  (google doc) recommended timeline (external link, opens in new window)  to help programs plan and schedule accordingly for their review. this timeline is mapped to an october start-date, but can be used as a roadmap to schedule ppr sequencing whenever the program chooses to begin its ppr.\\ncontact your curriculum specialist for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what if the program is also scheduled to complete a professional accreditation review? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npprs may be coordinated with any professional accreditation review, if feasible, and accreditation review information can be used to supplement the ppr. however, a self-study and appendices, separate from an accreditation review report, are required since pprs and accreditation reviews have different requirements, purposes, and goals.\\nthe vice-provost academic may require a separate peer review team (prt) when the accrediting body's assessment does not fully cover all areas required by the university's ppr process. the ppr prt report must also be a separate document from the accreditation prt report.\\nthe curriculum quality team is available to work with accredited programs to identify areas of overlap and help make the ppr and accreditation complimentary processes. professionally accredited undergraduate programs should consult the vice-provost academic for further guidance and assistance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            who participates in course mapping?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe ppr process should engage all teaching members of the program in the course mapping. once the learning outcomes have been established by the core ppr team of the school/department, all relevant courses to the degree should be mapped accordingly. many programs at tmu rely on cupe 1 contract lecturers for the delivery of compulsory courses. as the ppr process offers programs the opportunity to reflect on current practices, it is therefore important to include course perspectives as taught by cupe 1 contract lecturers.\\nplease note that cupe 1 contract lecturers participating in the course mapping process are to be remunerated as follows: a minimum of 2 hours at $100.00/hour. please note that cupe 1 contract lecturers, either with a teaching contract during this process, or not, are to be invited into the process and paid according to the above guidelines. the mapping work is considered out-of-scope as per articles 17.2 and 17.3 of the unit 1 collective agreement.\\nthe payment can be processed via a  (pdf file) personnel action form. the rationale for the payment must be included on the form. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            who is involved in the ppr self-study?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe ppr is usually led by a small team (made up of faculty, plus administrative support) who are responsible for data collection, analysis, and writing the self-study. however, a successful and effective program review depends on active involvement and support from a range of contributors, including the program director/chair or director of the school/department, curriculum committee, faculty/instructors, students, and the faculty dean.\\nthe office of the vice-provost academic advises programs throughout the review process to ensure that policy requirements are met. each program is assigned a curriculum specialist to provide personalized support and guidance throughout the ppr

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncourse intentions do not guarantee you a spot in your selected courses, however, they raise the chances of you being enrolled in them. \\nthe three most common reasons students are not placed into a course they intended for are:\\n\\ncourse conflict - two intended courses are scheduled at the same time; you are enrolled in only one of the two conflicts; and/or\\ncourse at capacity - there were more intentions for the course  than seats in the class. not all students with intentions  could be enrolled; and/or\\nmissing prerequisite(s) - you have not successfully met the prerequisite requirement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            why didn\\'t i receive a class schedule?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe two most common reasons why a student is missing a class schedule include:\\n\\ncourse intentions were unsuccessfully submitted for the term (see course intentions tab

the process of selecting courses that you plan to take over the upcoming academic terms and adding them to your schedule in myservicehub. it\\'s the period of time at the start of each term where you

course\\nlook to see if there is an alternative course that will fulfill the same degree requirement being offered that term. it is always best to get into a backup course and then switch out if a space opens up in the course that you want, rather than run the risk of being left with no course at all. \\nwaitlists\\nnot all courses offer a waitlist option, but a lot do. if there is a waitlist, get yourself on to it, and as people drop the course, you will move up the list.\\nmake sure you understand how waitlists work, as every year people try to put themselves onto a waitlist for a course that they are already in.\\n note: waitlists are not for swapping sections - they are there to help students get into a course they are not yet in. \\nlearn more about

successfully completed course intentions.\\nin order for your course intentions to be successfully completed, please ensure that there is a green checkmark beside each course (not green dot).\\ncourse intentions do not guarantee enrolment, but they do give you the best chance of securing the courses you want.\\n note: try to avoid intending for more courses than you need. the more courses you add to your intentions, the more courses there are to schedule to your timetable, and the greater risk of a time conflict.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            why can\\'t i add a course during course intentions?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyou may encounter an error message during the course intention selection process. some possible reasons could include:\\n\\nthe course you are trying to add requires \"departmental permission\". for courses requiring \\'departmental permission\\', you will need to contact the department offering the course during the course intention period to have that course manually added to your intentions. you cannot add the course yourself.\\nrestricted courses: some courses are restricted (i.e. off limits) for some programs during the course intention period. for example, an rta course may be restricted to rta students for the course intentions period. the university will make sure all programs that require the course have first enrolment. only once those students are all in, will any remaining spots become available for general enrolment. this typically happens during the \\'open enrolment period\\'.\\nthe course you are trying to add is not part of your curriculum and is non-applicable to your degree requirements.\\ntaking courses out of sequence. for example, myservicehub may block enrollment if you try to add a lower level liberal studies (table a) course, which is normally taken during the first two years in the program, to your course intentions selections for third year.\\ncourse prerequisite(s) not met.\\nyou may have a hold on your account that blocks enrollment. an account hold is a restriction placed on your myservicehub account related to outstanding fees owed or other unresolved obligations with the university. to resolve this hold you will need to review your holds in your student center on myservicehub and contact the appropriate department for further advice (as indicated in the hold description).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n    course categories & degree

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nquestion \\nanswer \\n\\n\\nwhat do i need to know as a graduating student? \\nhead over to our graduate checklist to make sure you check off all that needs to get done for a smooth convocation experience.   \\n\\n\\nhow do i get tickets? what do i need to know about tickets? \\nto obtain tickets, you must request them when you register for your convocation ceremony.  each grad will receive guest tickets each with a unique barcode (number of guest tickets will be 3 or 4 depending on how many graduates are in a ceremony). each ticket may be sent directly to guests (via email) or downloaded and distributed to each of your guests manually. each ticket may only be scanned once - please ensure that each of your guests has a unique ticket in hand (on a mobile device or a printed copy) for the ceremony. guests who do not have a unique ticket will not be permitted entry into the convocation arena. extra tickets for seating are not available for any convocation ceremony. \\n\\n\\ndo children need tickets to attend the ceremony?\\nanyone older than five years will need their own ticket. younger children can attend without a ticket but must sit in a guest's lap. please keep in mind the ceremonies are typically two hours long. we encourage guests with young children to sit near exits in case you need to step outside.   \\n\\n\\nis there a fee to attend convocation?\\nthere is a $55 ceremony fee. this fee includes: the use of regalia, guest tickets, and the post-ceremony celebration for you and your guests. \\n\\n\\nwhen do i arrive for my ceremony? \\narrive on time for your ceremony (8:00 a.m. for 9:30 a.m. ceremony; 2:00 p.m. for 3:30 p.m. ceremony) and sign in using your confirmation or onecard. the procession starts 30 minutes before the ceremony, so it is very important for you to arrive on time. \\n\\n\\nwhat do i do with personal items on the day of my ceremony? \\npersonal items may be left in the line up area (this area is unsupervised) or you may bring them with you into the convocation arena.  if you are arriving with your guests you may also leave items with them. hold on to your phone for photos of your big day! \\n\\n\\nwhat should i tell my guests? \\nlet guests know that doors open 1h30min before the ceremony. they may arrive then or anytime before the graduand procession (9:00 a.m. or 3:00 p.m, depending on your ceremony time). there is no assigned seating. guests may also refer to the information for guests page to learn more. note, no helium balloons are allowed inside of the mattamy athletic centre. should you or your guests bring any, you will be asked to dispose of them at the entrance. \\n\\n\\nwhat do i wear to my ceremony? \\nwe suggest business or business casual attire to wear under your academic regalia. for more information about what you can wear, read our regalia guidelines. we also suggest that you wear comfortable shoes! you will be standing, walking and climbing flights of stairs for more than an hour before your ceremony commences. only phd grads wear mortarboards/hats as part of their regalia. \\n\\n\\nwhat happens during the ceremony? \\nyou will be guided through your convocation ceremony by marshals. they will seat you, line you up before crossing the stage, and answer your questions along the way.  the most important things to remember are: don't lose your namecard and have fun! convocation ceremonies are typically two hours. \\n\\n\\nwhat happens after the ceremony?  \\npost-ceremony celebrations are held on the fourth floor. enjoy and celebrate! you will need to retain your rsvp confirmation or your onecard to checkout of the ceremony. \\n\\n\\nwhere do i return my regalia? \\nreturn your regalia to grad gown return no later than one hour after your ceremony. if you do not return your gown and hood you will be invoiced $150. you will not be able to obtain transcripts until payment is made or the regalia is returned in good condition. \\n\\n\\ni have an accommodation request for myself or my guest. what should i do? \\nyou will have an opportunity to make an accommodation request when you register for your convocation ceremony. accessible seating for guests is provided on the third floor of the mac.  all ceremonies have live asl interpreters and live-captioning on screen in the convocation arena. for more information contact the ceremonials office at convocation@torontomu.ca. \\n\\n\\ni'm not planning, or cannot attend my convocation. what do i do? \\nif you are not attending convocation, you may graduate in absentia. if extenuating circumstances arise that affect your ability to attend your convocation ceremony, a case-file may be started to evaluate your attendance eligibility. please visit the curriculum advising page to learn more. when graduating in absentia, after july 1 or november 1 (for spring or fall convocation), you may arrange a courier of your document by logging into your servicehub account and submitting an online graduation document courier request. alternatively, your award document will be made available for pick-up at the servicehub, pod150. if you are unable to pick up your document yourself you may authorize someone else to pick it up on your behalf. you must provide this individual with a letter of authorization, which must include: your signature, your full name, your student number, your program name, term of graduation, and the full name of the person you are authorizing to pick up your document. the individual picking up your document must also provide photo identification proving they are the person stated in the authorization letter. \\n\\n\\nhow do i take graduation photos?\\ngrad photos and class composites are a service provided by the tmu students' union (external link) . please contact them directly for more information.\\n\\n\\nwhere/when can i get my photo taken after i crossed the convocation stage? where can i get my class

our operating revenues are related to enrolment. approximately 56 per cent of our operating budget comes from tuition fees, 36 per cent from grants, and 8 per cent from other income-generating activities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what are toronto metropolitan university's main expenses?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe majority of our expenditures are for academic and student support operations, with remaining funds supporting activities such as building maintenance, campus computing and technological services, research services, and administrative functions.\\nnearly three-quarters of our operating expenditures are for salaries and benefits. the majority of these costs are determined by negotiated collective agreements with our three main unions: the toronto metropolitan faculty association (tfa), the ontario public service employees union (opseu), and the canadian union of public employees (cupe).\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            will the university experience any funding reductions this year?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin november 2023, ontario's blue-ribbon panel on postsecondary education financial sustainability recommended an increase of 5 per cent in tuition fees for 2024-25 (8 per cent for professional programs), with additional annual increases in future years. the panel also recommended an increase of 10 per cent in the government core operating grant along with annual increases in future years.  \\nas of late january 2024, the government has not formally announced a decision about the recommendations of the blue-ribbon panel. \\nin 2019-20, the government of ontario required universities to reduce domestic tuition fees by 10 per cent relative to 2018-19 levels. this brought fees back to approximately 2015-16 levels. fees have remained frozen at that reduced level. forgoing a tuition increase for even one year has a cumulative impact that will last for years to come. in every year following the freeze, any increases will be based on a lower tuition amount, meaning there will be a continued gap between inflation and incremental revenue. fees for international enrolment and cost-recovery programming, activity not supported with government grants, are not subject to this policy.\\nat the same time, there is uncertainty about how the recent federal decision to limit the number of international student study permits will be implemented, and what it will mean for international enrolment at tmu.\\ntoronto metropolitan university will continue ongoing conversations with our sector partners and take part in discussions with the ministry regarding guidelines and implementation details. in tandem, toronto metropolitan university will continue to develop contingency plans and options to address potential revenue loss.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            will planned capital projects be affected by changes in funding/anticipated budget cuts?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe university receives funding for capital projects from sources such as special, one-time government infrastructure allocations or from donations, and the funds are earmarked for specific building projects. funds for capital projects are one-time only and are not part of the university's base budget, which funds ongoing expenditures. capital projects are therefore not affected by base budget reductions, and deferring capital projects will not result in base savings to the university. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how will the academic plan influence where money is spent across the university?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntoronto metropolitan university's academic plan 2020-25 incorporates extensive feedback from students, faculty, and staff. budget planning and resource allocations are directly tied to the following five priorities, which will guide the direction of the university:\\n\\nthe student experience;\\nscholarly, research, and creative activity and graduate studies;\\nadvancing indigenous initiatives;\\ninnovation: continuing to challenge the status quo; and\\ncommunity and urban partnerships.\\n\\ntoronto metropolitan university has also undertaken broad internal and external consultations on a range of foundational strategies that will help guide and shape our institution. a developing blueprint, these five complementary plans (including the academic plan) articulate our academic and strategic directions:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n (pdf file) \\nthe campus master plan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n (pdf file) \\ninternational

is the strategic vision 2020-2030. this overarching framework serves as the foundation or roadmap, moving toronto metropolitan university toward the same vision and goals.\\nconsultations for the next academic plan are currently underway. \\n\\n\\nview all guiding plans\\n (opens in new window) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            why can't fundraising revenues be used to avoid budget cuts?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndonations tend to be directed to support designated student bursaries, short-term initiatives or specific projects, rather than being available for general operating purposes.\\nfor permanent staff positions and long-term commitments (e.g., maintenance of buildings, utilities), the university cannot rely on short-term donations or other one-time-only funds such as short-term grants or contracts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how will the strategic mandate agreement (sma) affect our funding?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstrategic mandate agreements (smas) are established through negotiations with the ministry of colleges and universities that provide universities and colleges with an opportunity to communicate priorities, identify areas of institutional strength/focus, and set performance metrics. toronto metropolitan university and the ministry signed the 2020-2025 strategic mandate agreement (external link)  on august 31, 2020.\\na portion of the university's funding is tied to performance on metrics as of 2023-24. \\ntoronto metropolitan university successfully completed the ministry's sma3 year 3 annual evaluation in 2023, and is currently participating in the ministry's sma3 year 4 annual evaluation process (from november 27, 2023 to march 15, 2024) which continues data collection and analysis, assesses 2023-24 performance, and sets targets for 2024-25. tmu does not anticipate significant financial risks associated with sma metric performance in 2024-25.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            has toronto metropolitan university considered external partnerships (outside of government) to diversify our revenue streams?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyes, for example, there is a long-term strategic partnership between toronto metropolitan university and navitas. the cornerstone of this partnership, known as toronto metropolitan university international college (tmuic) (external link) , launched in winter 2021. it is a new, additional pathway program for international students designed to ease the transition to a canadian university environment and to prepare them for academic success. the partnership will accelerate tmu's internationalization goals by growing and diversifying its international student population and enhancing toronto metropolitan university's global reach.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            why is the university opening a new school of medicine at this time?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe expectation is that the ongoing activities related to this initiative will be supported by new, incremental revenue that is not related to our current enrolment. the government of ontario announced its support for the school of medicine, including funding for 94 undergraduate and 105 postgraduate seats that are resourced separately from tmu's existing enrolment. the city of brampton donated an existing building along with funds to support renovations to establish the physical site for the school, and tmu is working with the federal and provincial governments and private donors to seek additional funding to support capital development.\\nontario is facing a shortage of primary care physicians who are unevenly distributed across communities, contributing to growing unmet care needs. for example, brampton is one of canada's most culturally diverse and fastest-growing cities. in spite of this dynamism, its residents experience significant challenges with access to appropriate, high-quality primary care.  tmu has the opportunity to engage with the brampton community and the surrounding region to develop a model for health care that can be adopted throughout ontario and beyond.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what are the financial actuals for last year, and where can a breakdown of the budget be found

increased grants? do the funding metrics under the strategic mandate agreement make any additional funding available?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nalong with sector partners and the council of ontario universities (cou), we continue to make the case for sustainable, ongoing funding as recommended by the ontario blue-ribbon panel on postsecondary education financial sustainability. we have not yet attained an increase in the level of our operating grants. this continues to be a goal, and we will continue to demonstrate the need for an increased level of ongoing funding. \\nthe funding metrics that are part of the government's strategic mandate agreement process make an increasing portion of an institution's existing government grants subject to meeting performance targets rather than allocating meaningful new funding.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how will the federal government's cap on international student visas affect tmu? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe federal government sets a cap for each province, and individual provinces decide on the allocation among their institutions. at this time, the province has not announced how it will allocate spaces within ontario. tmu is advocating for an allocation that allows continued growth from the university's relatively low current levels. our university has taken a measured approach to international enrolment, with roughly 10 per cent of our enrolment accounted for by international students compared to a system average of about 20 per cent. it should be noted that the cap does not apply to graduate programs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n    students, faculty & staff\\r\\n

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwe understand the financial burden faced by many students. student support expenditures by the university for 2023-24 to date (as of january 31, 2024) total $42.2 million.   \\nin addition, the government of canada has suspended the accumulation of interest on canada student loans and canada apprentice loans as of april 1, 2023. \\nmore information about financial support

process? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nas demonstrated in past years, toronto metropolitan university is focused on our core values throughout the budget-planning and consultation process - especially protecting and enhancing the student experience. the 2024-25 budget cycle will continue to prioritize the student community. in the past year, the university has made significant investments in student wellness, for example.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how is student aid funded?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstudent aid is funded through a combination of tuition fees and additional revenue streams, such as donations. in some cases, specific bursaries are funded through allocations made from department/faculty budgets.\\ntmu participates in the student access guarantee (sag) as required by the provincial government, covering direct costs for unmet need as assessed by osap through scholarships, bursaries or work-study employment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how does international tuition revenue get used? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ninternational tuition provides an important revenue stream for tmu. this revenue supports core teaching and learning functions at the university, and is also used for

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngiven student demand for toronto metropolitan university programs, we are on track to meet domestic enrolment targets for fall 2024. it is important to note that toronto metropolitan university is unable to increase domestic enrolment because the government has capped the number of funded spaces. \\nthe federal government's recently announced cap on international student visas and delays with visa approvals present some challenges with international enrolment planning. our current level of international enrolment is low relative to other ontario universities, and increasing this is an important objective.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how does revenue from continuing education (ce) impact the budget? can we increase

degree-credit and certificate-credit courses. degree credit enrolment is counted as part of our enrolment that is funded by the government, which is capped at the overall university level. other chang school enrolments that are not degree-credit are not subject to limits and we will work to increase enrolment in these courses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            what

than 90 per cent of our operating revenues come from tuition fees and grants associated with enrolment. in other words, our financial health as an institution relies on enrolment. demand for toronto metropolitan university programs is strong. that said, domestic spaces are capped by the government, which precludes us from increasing the number of domestic students to generate additional revenue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nquick links\\n\\n\\n\\noffice of the provost and vice-president, academic \\nuniversity planning

tools has raised a number of questions for instructors and students alike. recognizing that the pace at which these technologies are developing, as well as the infancy of established best practices for ai in postsecondary education, below are the university\\'s current recommendations in the form of questions and answers.\\ninstructors who\\'d like to learn more about ai in higher ed are encouraged to review the centre for excellence in learning & teaching\\'s new teaching resources page, join our community of practice (external link)  (cop) and/or to explore the faculty-led video presentations that have taken place during our cop lunch and learns.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nopen all close all\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            should students use ai?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nunless explicitly stated by the instructor, students should assume that using ai to complete assessments is prohibited. if students use ai to complete assessments, instructors may consider it 1) misrepresentation of personal identity or performance and/or 2) plagiarism and/or 3) cheating.\\nif your instructor gives you permission to use ai, the expectation is that you cite the output just as you would cite any other source. \\napa (external link) , mla (external link) , chicago style (external link) \\nwhile ai is something that should be avoided when creating anything that will be evaluated by your professor, ai can be a great learning companion, assuming you understand that ai output needs to be critically evaluated. cornell university (external link)  devised these key questions that you can use to interrogate the integrity of the ai output:\\n\\nis the ai-generated content accurate? how can you test or assess the accuracy?\\ncan other credible sources (outside of generative ai) validate the data or item produced? \\nhow does the information generated impact or influence your thinking on this topic?\\nwho is represented in this data? is the data inclusive in terms of the material\\'s scope and the perspectives that it presents? \\n\\nas well, we have some  (google doc) student tips (external link)  that you may find useful.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            does policy 60: academic integrity prohibit student use of ai for assessments?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncurrently, policy 60 (opens in new window)  does not explicitly address ai usage. however, if a student were to submit text, images, designs or any other academic work generated by ai without proper attribution, instructors could consider that plagiarism. further, instructors could consider ai use to be cheating as described in policy 60, appendix a, section 3.1:\\n\"having ready access to and/or using aids or devices (including wireless communication devices) not expressly allowed by the instructor during an examination, test, quiz, or other evaluation.\"\\n* please note that policy 60 is currently under review and we anticipate that specific language on artificial intelligence will be added.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            can instructors prohibit and/or authorize student use of ai on assessment?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nin either case, yes, but be mindful of a few things:\\n\\nlearn about the technology (external link, opens in new window) , external link and read openai\\'s educator considerations for chatgpt (external link, opens in new window) \\ndiscuss the strengths and weaknesses of ai large language models (llms) with your students\\nset very clear academic integrity parameters (are translators allowed? grammar correctors? can students use it to

with this generic transfer credit? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhen an incoming course is assessed for equivalency, normally a specific toronto metropolitan university course is established as equivalent transfer credit. in circumstances where a specific transfer credit cannot be established, sometimes a generic transfer credit is established as an equivalent transfer credit.      \\nfor example, law gen is granted when the incoming course is not directly equivalent to law 122. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            i completed a two semester course but was only granted one transfer credit. should this not be equivalent to two credits?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na full-year course is eligible for two transfer credits, however, only one credit may be granted if the course content only covers the subject matter of one toronto metropolitan university course.\\nif you feel that an additional credit may be overlooked by the evaluator, you may submit a transfer credit reassessment to have the application reconsidered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            i disagree with the transfer credit decision i received. can i request a reassessment?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyes. please refer to the reassessment section of this site for more details.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            can a course be considered for a liberal studies credit if it does not meet the writing requirement?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nno. all courses must meet the writing requirement to be considered for a liberal studies credit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            i took my courses more than 10 years ago. can i still apply for transfer credits? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntoronto metropolitan university considers most courses for transfer credits, regardless of how long ago they were completed.  \\nsince course content is subject to change over time and in order to meet current curriculum, accreditation and learning outcome requirements, some courses completed 10 or more years ago may not be recognized for transfer credit. for example, computer science, nursing, media studies, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            how do i get a transfer credit removed from my transfer credit report? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsubmit your request via email to

It is suggested that you should complete all prerequisite courses prior to applying for the program as you would need to provide official transcripts of successful completion of the courses.\\nIf you believe that your undergraduate transcript contains courses that may cover the subject matter of one or more prerequisite courses, you can indicate that in your statement of interest. Please note that the selection committee may or may not accept these courses as equivalents of one or more of the prerequisite courses. If you are in the process of completing the prerequisite courses at the time of your application, please indicate that in your statement of interest.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            I have been out of university for several/many years, and I am having difficulty finding two academic references? What should I do?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is acceptable to submit one professional reference, however, you must make every effort to submit at least one academic reference.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            How is the program offered?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe program is offered as a one-year full-time or a two-year part-time MRP option or as a two year full-time Thesis option. Full-time students have to be registered for a minimum of three terms (one year) and part-time students have to be registered for a minimum of six terms (two years).\\nLearn more about the\\xa0program options.\\xa0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            When will the courses be scheduled?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll program specific (DS) courses will be scheduled in the evening for both full-time and part-time students. The classes usually run between 6 and 9 pm on Toronto Metropolitan University campus.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            How many courses can I take per term?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFull-time students should expect to have three courses per term in Fall and Winter, with the Seminar course and MRP to be completed in the Spring/Summer term.\\nPart-time students can take no more than 2 courses per term.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            What is the expected workload for full-time students?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn Fall and Winter terms, apart from attending classes three evenings per week, full-time students can expect to contribute up to 18-24 additional hours of work per week.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            Does the program offer any funding?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFull-time students in the program are eligible to be considered for limited funding from the program on a competitive basis. Part-time students are not eligible for funding. In addition, full-time students are eligible to apply for any GA or RA opportunities that are posted on Toronto Metropolitan University careers page.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            What are the future career and/or academic prospects with a Master of Science degree in Data Science and Analytics?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nData scientists are in high demand. Data intense industries such as health care, banking, retail, energy, telecom and media are looking for data scientists. Students may also apply for a PhD after completing this program.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            What is the difference between the MSc program in Data Science and Analytics and the Certificate in Data Analytics, Big Data and Predictive Analytics at the G.Raymond Chang School of Continuing Education?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe certificate prepares you for the basic skills and entry level jobs in analytics, whereas the MSc program gives deeper technical skills for higher level jobs. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            What is the seminar course?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe course will focus on communicating and presenting data analysis results. It aims at building the competency in storytelling from the numbers. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            What is the difference between an MRP and a thesis?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe MRP is a project rather than a thesis. It is applied, whereas thesis is research-focused.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            Can I switch from FT to PT option and vice versa while in the program?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYes. However, all requests for change of status are subject to consultation with and the approval of the Program Director. A student may not transfer from full-time to part-time status when the only remaining graduation requirement is an MRP.

However, all requests for change of status are subject to consultation with and the approval of the Program Director. A student may not transfer from full-time to part-time status when the only remaining graduation requirement is an MRP. For students who request a change in status from FT to PT option or vice versa, the effect on the time of completion will be pro-rated. Students switching from FT to PT will no longer be eligible for any funding they may have received from the program. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYeates School of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies 1 Dundas St. West, 11th floor Toronto, ON M5G 1Z3\\n\\xa0\\nCONTACT US Email:\\xa0gradhelp@torontomu.ca Website:\\xa0www.torontomu.ca/future-students Phone:\\xa0(416) 979-5150 Fax:\\xa0(416) 979-5153\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClick to Activate Map\\n\\n\\nMap of 1 Dundas St. West Toronto, ON M5S 2Z3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nToronto Metropolitan University\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t            350 Victoria Street\\r\\n\\t\\t            Toronto, ON M5B 2K3\\nP: 416-979-5000\\r\\n\\t\\t        \\n\\nDirectory\\nMaps and Directions\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow Us\\n\\nFacebook, opens new window\\nInstagram, opens new window\\nX, opens new window\\nYouTube, opens new window\\nLinkedIn, opens new window\\nTiktok, opens new window\\nThreads, opens new window\\n\\n\\nCareers\\nMedia Room\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\nAccessibility\\nTerms & Conditions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', metadata={'language': 'en', 'source': 'https://www.torontomu.ca/graduate/datascience/admission/faq/', 'title': 'FAQ - Data Science and Analytics - Toronto Metropolitan University\\r\\n    '}),\n",

Your diploma will also include your major on it, however if you choose to do a minor it will not show up on your diploma. Minors are documented on your official transcript.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            What will first year at School Of Business Management be like? \\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst year is a fun and exciting time, but will also involve a lot of work too! During the year you will meet tons of new people and have a lot of new academic experiences (lectures, labs and tutorials to name a few). This is a time for you to explore the different opportunities and resources that exist at the Ted Rogers School of Management and Toronto Metropolitan University.\\nYour first year in the program will be a general year where you take several introductory courses that expose you to the different subject areas. This will prepare you for the rest of your studies and help you decide on what you would like to major in. The School of Business Management is made up of seven unique majors. Your major is the subject area that you specialize in, meaning that there will be a certain amount of mandatory courses that you will need to take in that subject area to complete your major.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n    Deregistration\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOpen All Close All\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            What Is deregistration?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeregistration is the removal of a student from classes by his or her School for a semester for failing to meet the requirements which the university makes a pre-condition of being allowed to register for courses. Deregistered students can earn no credit towards their degree in that semester.\\nDeregistration happens in the Ted Rogers School of Business Management when probationary students do not have their Plan of Study for a particular semester approved by the School. Since they have failed to comply with the University\\'s requirement that probationary students \"may not continue their program studies until a specific plan for studies has been authorized by their program School or Department and recorded with the Registrar\", and since they have failed to have a probationary plan of studies (i.e. probationary contract) approved by their program department, the Ted Rogers School of Business Management has students\\' course enrolments and course intention requests cancelled for the term in question.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            Can deregistered students take Continuing Education courses instead?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe restriction also applies to courses taken through Continuing Education or, indeed at any other institution, while a student is deregistered. However, courses can be taken for other, non-degree credit reasons, such as for interest, to practice improving study skills, or to complete a certificate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            Are deregistration and being \\'Required To Withdraw\\' the same thing?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo, they are very different, although in both cases the students are out of school for a determined period of time and receive no credit toward their degree for any courses taken during that time.\\nDeregistration is not an Academic Standing like Probation or being Required to Withdraw. It is the administrative action taken when students on probation fail to comply with the university\\'s requirement that they should have their courses approved (i.e. a probationary contract). Deregistered students are still in the program on probation; they are simply not allowed to register for a semester. Their transcript will show only that they took no courses that semester; it will not indicate why. Deregistered students are not required to follow any program nor, since they are still in the program, to apply for reinstatement. Space is guaranteed for them in the following semester, as it is for all students who are not on Required to Withdraw, and course selections for the next semester are retained and used to construct their timetables. They are entitled to continue in the following semester, assuming that they have their probationary plan of study approved and their contract signed.\\n\\'Required to Withdraw\\'\\xa0(opens in new window)\\xa0 is an Academic Standing indicating performance that is well below acceptable norms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            Don\\'t you think it\\'s very unfair to stop someone from taking courses after they\\'ve paid their fees?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYes, it would be very unfair to do that since it is the Ted Rogers School of Business Management, acting in accordance with the university\\'s requirements, which deregisters the student. That\\'s why the fees for the semester are returned by the university. The Fees Department credits the deregistered student\\'s account as soon as the Ted Rogers School of Business Management sends the Department notice of the deregistration. Continuing Education fees are also credited in the same way. The student may leave the money there to be used the following semester or may make a request in writing to the Fees Department that the fees be returned to them. A cheque is not sent out automatically, partly because students change their residences quite often without notifying Records and partly because, since they are out of School for a semester, deregistered students may return home for the semester to work. The Fees Department wants to be sure that the refund goes to the right place and is not cashed by someone other than the student.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            Don\\'t you think it\\'s a bit extreme to make a student lose a whole semester just for a technicality?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNot doing what you must do as a probationary student is not a technicality, it is a serious matter. The Ted Rogers School of Business Management has to set deadlines so that we know what probationary students are doing and whether they are following the requirements approved by Business Council for Probationary students. The probationary students\\' contracts must be approved as soon as possible so that the students know where they stand and what they are responsible for from the beginning; that\\'s why we try to make that contracts are signed in early June for the Fall semester and as early as possible in the Winter semester.\\nThe Ted Rogers School of Business Management must ensure that the deadlines are enforced so that we know who has complied with the university\\'s requirements. We tried an honour system with the Plans of Study and the contracts before but very few students complied. Many claimed that there were unaware that they had to do so or that they had to meet certain specific requirements. That\\'s why we now make sure that every probationary student is operating under the same rules, and meeting deadlines is part of that. In fact, most probationary students are very responsible about meeting their deadlines. It would be very unfair if those who do not feel they should be subject to the same requirements as others, or who don\\'t bother to find out what they must do on probation, were to be rewarded for their lack of responsibility.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            What should a student do when they get a notice saying they are deregistered?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore the notice is sent, The Ted Rogers School of Business Management drops them out of all their courses. There is nothing else they must do except keep the letter somewhere safe, since it if the proof that we have done so.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            What should a deregistered student do during the semester they are out of school?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWork on ensuring that whatever caused the problems that put them on probation in the first place will not affect them when they come back. If a student is not sure what to do to ensure this, or doesn\\'t think that they were responsible for going on probation, they should make an appointment with the Academic advisor to discuss the situation. A full/part-time job will also provide new and useful perspectives which will help the student focus on studying, especially if it leads to a new career direction, when they return to school.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n    Current Students\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOpen All Close All\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            How can I declare my minor?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can only declare your minor after you have applied to graduate.

During the year you will meet tons of new people and have a lot of new academic experiences (lectures, labs and tutorials to name a few). This is a time for you to explore the different opportunities and resources that exist at the Ted Rogers School of Management and Toronto Metropolitan University.\\nYour first year in the program will be a general year where you take several introductory courses that expose you to the different subject areas. This will prepare you for the rest of your studies and help you decide on what you would like to major in. The School of Business Management is made up of seven unique majors. Your major is the subject area that you specialize in, meaning that there will be a certain amount of mandatory courses that you will need to take in that subject area to complete your major.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n    Deregistration\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOpen All Close All\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            What Is deregistration?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeregistration is the removal of a student from classes by his or her School for a semester for failing to meet the requirements which the university makes a pre-condition of being allowed to register for courses. Deregistered students can earn no credit towards their degree in that semester.\\nDeregistration happens in the Ted Rogers School of Business Management when probationary students do not have their Plan of Study for a particular semester approved by the School. Since they have failed to comply with the University\\'s requirement that probationary students \"may not continue their program studies until a specific plan for studies has been authorized by their program School or Department and recorded with the Registrar\", and since they have failed to have a probationary plan of studies (i.e. probationary contract) approved by their program department, the Ted Rogers School of Business Management has students\\' course enrolments and course intention requests cancelled for the term in question.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            Can deregistered students take Continuing Education courses instead?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe restriction also applies to courses taken through Continuing Education or, indeed at any other institution, while a student is deregistered. However, courses can be taken for other, non-degree credit reasons, such as for interest, to practice improving study skills, or to complete a certificate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            Are deregistration and being \\'Required To Withdraw\\' the same thing?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo, they are very different, although in both cases the students are out of school for a determined period of time and receive no credit toward their degree for any courses taken during that time.\\nDeregistration is not an Academic Standing like Probation or being Required to Withdraw. It is the administrative action taken when students on probation fail to comply with the university\\'s requirement that they should have their courses approved (i.e. a probationary contract). Deregistered students are still in the program on probation; they are simply not allowed to register for a semester. Their transcript will show only that they took no courses that semester; it will not indicate why. Deregistered students are not required to follow any program nor, since they are still in the program, to apply for reinstatement. Space is guaranteed for them in the following semester, as it is for all students who are not on Required to Withdraw, and course selections for the next semester are retained and used to construct their timetables. They are entitled to continue in the following semester, assuming that they have their probationary plan of study approved and their contract signed.\\n\\'Required to Withdraw\\'\\xa0(opens in new window)\\xa0 is an Academic Standing indicating performance that is well below acceptable norms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            Don\\'t you think it\\'s very unfair to stop someone from taking courses after they\\'ve paid their fees?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYes, it would be very unfair to do that since it is the Ted Rogers School of Business Management, acting in accordance with the university\\'s requirements, which deregisters the student. That\\'s why the fees for the semester are returned by the university. The Fees Department credits the deregistered student\\'s account as soon as the Ted Rogers School of Business Management sends the Department notice of the deregistration. Continuing Education fees are also credited in the same way. The student may leave the money there to be used the following semester or may make a request in writing to the Fees Department that the fees be returned to them. A cheque is not sent out automatically, partly because students change their residences quite often without notifying Records and partly because, since they are out of School for a semester, deregistered students may return home for the semester to work. The Fees Department wants to be sure that the refund goes to the right place and is not cashed by someone other than the student.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            Don\\'t you think it\\'s a bit extreme to make a student lose a whole semester just for a technicality?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNot doing what you must do as a probationary student is not a technicality, it is a serious matter. The Ted Rogers School of Business Management has to set deadlines so that we know what probationary students are doing and whether they are following the requirements approved by Business Council for Probationary students. The probationary students\\' contracts must be approved as soon as possible so that the students know where they stand and what they are responsible for from the beginning; that\\'s why we try to make that contracts are signed in early June for the Fall semester and as early as possible in the Winter semester.\\nThe Ted Rogers School of Business Management must ensure that the deadlines are enforced so that we know who has complied with the university\\'s requirements. We tried an honour system with the Plans of Study and the contracts before but very few students complied. Many claimed that there were unaware that they had to do so or that they had to meet certain specific requirements. That\\'s why we now make sure that every probationary student is operating under the same rules, and meeting deadlines is part of that. In fact, most probationary students are very responsible about meeting their deadlines. It would be very unfair if those who do not feel they should be subject to the same requirements as others, or who don\\'t bother to find out what they must do on probation, were to be rewarded for their lack of responsibility.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            What should a student do when they get a notice saying they are deregistered?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore the notice is sent, The Ted Rogers School of Business Management drops them out of all their courses. There is nothing else they must do except keep the letter somewhere safe, since it if the proof that we have done so.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            What should a deregistered student do during the semester they are out of school?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWork on ensuring that whatever caused the problems that put them on probation in the first place will not affect them when they come back. If a student is not sure what to do to ensure this, or doesn\\'t think that they were responsible for going on probation, they should make an appointment with the Academic advisor to discuss the situation. A full/part-time job will also provide new and useful perspectives which will help the student focus on studying, especially if it leads to a new career direction, when they return to school.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n    Current Students\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOpen All Close All\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                            How can I declare my minor?\\r\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can only declare your minor after you have applied to graduate.

Many courses list as part of the prerequisite the phrase “or Direct Entry”. This means that, as a Direct Entry student, you are deemed to have met the prerequisites for the course as long as the prerequisite is not an assigned Reachback, and as long as the course is one of your required or professional courses.\\nMake sure you plan the sequence of your courses so that you will have the appropriate prerequisites for any course you want to take.
